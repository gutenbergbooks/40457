<h2>TO THE GENTLE READER</h2>


<p class="cap noin">The walls of the temple of King Sety at
Abydos in Upper Egypt are decorated
with sculptured scenes which represent the cult
of the gods and the offerings brought to them.
In a side chapel there is depicted the following
curious scene. A dead figure lies extended on a
bier; sorrowing hawks surround him; a flying
hawk reaches down a seal amulet from above.
Had I succeeded in procuring a picture of the
scene, it would stand reproduced here; for the
figure and his mourners recalled the quaint little
woodcut of a toy-book which told the tale of
the Death and Burial of Cock Robin. The sculptures
of Sety date from the fourteenth century
before Christ; the knell of the robin can be traced
back no further than the middle of the eighteenth
century A.D. Can the space that lies between be
bridged over, and the conception of the dead robin
be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
 linked on to that of the dead hawk? However
that may be, the sight of the sculptured
scene strengthened my resolve to place some of
the coincidences of comparative nursery lore before
the gentle reader. It lies with him to decide
whether the wares are such as to make a further
instalment desirable.</p>

<p class="chap">FIRST APPEARANCE OF RHYMES
IN PRINT</p>


<p class="cap noin">THE study of folk-lore has given a new
interest to much that seemed insignificant
and trivial. Among the unheeded possessions
of the past that have gained a fresh value are
nursery rhymes. A nursery rhyme I take to be
a rhyme that was passed on by word of mouth
and taught to children before it was set down
in writing and put into print. The use of the
term in this application goes back to the early
part of the nineteenth century. In 1834 John
Gawler, afterwards Bellenden Ker, published the
first volume of his <i>Essay on the Archaiology of
Popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
 English Phrases and Nursery Rhymes</i>,
a fanciful production. Prior to this time nursery
rhymes were usually spoken of as nursery songs.</p>

<p>The interest in these "unappreciated trifles
of the nursery," as Rimbault called them, was
aroused towards the close of the eighteenth
century. In a letter which Joseph Ritson wrote
to his little nephew, he mentioned the collection
of rhymes known as <i>Mother Goose's Melody</i>, and
assured him that he also would set about collecting
rhymes.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> His collection of rhymes is said, in the
<i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>, to have been
published at Stockton in 1783 under the title <i>Gammer
Gurton's Garland</i>. A copy of an anonymous
collection of rhymes published by Christopher
and Jennett at Stockton, which is called <i>Gammer
Gurton's Garland or the Nursery Parnassus</i>, is
now at the British Museum, and is designated
as a "new edition with additions." It bears no
name and no date, but its contents, which consist
of over seventy rhymes, agree with parts
1 and 2 of a large collection of nursery rhymes,
including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
 over one hundred and forty pieces,
which were published in 1810 by the publisher
R. Triphook, of 37 St. James Street, London,
who also issued other collections made by Ritson.</p>

<p>The collection of rhymes known as <i>Mother
Goose's Melody</i>, which aroused the interest of
Ritson, was probably the toy-book which was
entered for copyright in London on 28 December,
1780. Its title was <i>Mother Goose's Melody or
Sonnets for the Cradle</i>, and it was entered by
John Carnan, the stepson of the famous publisher
John Newbery, who had succeeded to the business
in partnership with Francis Newbery.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Of this
book no copy is known to exist. Toy-books,
owing to the careless way in which they are
handled, are amongst the most perishable literature.
Many toy-books are known to have been
issued in hundreds of copies, yet of some of these
not a single copy can now be traced.</p>

<p>The name Mother Goose, its connection with
nursery rhymes, and the date of issue of <i>Mother
Goose's Melody</i>, have been the subject of some
contention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
 Thomas Fleet, a well-known printer
of Boston, Mass., who was from Shropshire, is
said to have issued a collection of nursery rhymes
under the following title, <i>Songs for the Nursery,
or Mother Goose's Melodies for Children</i>, printed
by Thomas Fleet at his printing-house, Pudding
Lane, 1719, price two coppers.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The existence
of this book at the date mentioned has been both
affirmed and denied.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> John Fleet Eliot, a great-grandson
of the printer, accepted its existence, and
in 1834 wrote with regard to it as follows: "It is
well known to antiquaries that more than a hundred
years ago there was a small book in circulation
in London bearing the name of <i>Rhymes for the
Nursery or Lulla-Byes for Children</i>, which contained
many of the identical pieces of <i>Mother
Goose's Melodies</i> of the present day. It contained
also other pieces, more silly if possible,
and some that the American types of the present
day would refuse to give off an impression. The
cuts or illustrations thereof were of the coarsest
description."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
 On the other hand, the date of
1719 in connection with the expression "two
coppers," has been declared impossible. However
this may be, no copy of the book of Fleet or of
its presumed prototype has been traced.</p>

<p>The name Mother Goose, which John Newbery
and others associated with nursery rhymes, may
have been brought into England from France,
where <i>La Mère Oie</i> was connected with the telling
of fairy tales as far back as 1650.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> <i>La Mère Oie</i>
is probably a lineal descendant of <i>La Reine
Pédauque</i>, otherwise <i>Berthe au grand pied</i>, but
there is the possibility also of the relationship
to <i>Fru Gode</i> or <i>Fru Gosen</i> of German folk-lore.
We first come across Mother Goose in
England in connection with the famous puppet-showman
Robert Powell, who set up his show in
Bath and in Covent Garden, London, between
1709 and 1711. The repertory of his plays, which
were of his own composing, included <i>Whittington
and his Cat</i>, <i>The Children in the Wood</i>, <i>Friar
Bacon and Friar Bungay</i>, <i>Robin Hood and Little
John</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
 <i>Mother Shipton</i>, and <i>Mother Goose</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> A
play or pantomime called <i>Mother Goose</i> was still
popular at the beginning of the nineteenth
century, for the actor Grimaldi obtained his
greatest success in it in 1806.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The name Gammer Gurton which Ritson chose
for his collection of rhymes, was traditional also.
<i>Gammer Gurton's Needle</i> is the name of a famous
old comedy which dates from about the year
1566. The name also appears in connection
with nursery rhymes in a little toy-book, issued
by Lumsden in Glasgow, which is called <i>Gammer
Gurton's Garland of Nursery Songs, and Toby
Tickle's Collection of Riddles</i>. This is undated.
It occurs also in an insignificant little toy-book
called <i>The Topbook of all</i>, in connection with
Nurse Lovechild, Jacky Nory, and Tommy
Thumb. This book is also undated, but contains
the picture of a shilling of 1760 which is referred
to as "a new shilling."</p>

<p>The date at which nursery rhymes appeared in
print<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
 yields one clue to their currency at a given
period. The oldest dated collection of rhymes
which I have seen bears the title <i>Tommy Thumb's
Pretty Song Book</i>, vol. II, "sold by M. Cooper
according to Act of Parliament." It is printed
partly in red, partly in black, and on its last page
bears the date 1744. A copy of this is at the
British Museum.</p>

<p>Next to this in date is a toy-book which is
called <i>The Famous Tommy Thumb's Little Story-Book</i>,
printed and sold at the printing office in
Marlborough Street, 1771. A copy of this is in
the library of Boston, Mass. It contains nine
nursery rhymes at the end, which have been
reprinted by Whitmore.</p>

<p>Other collections of rhymes issued in America
have been preserved which are reprints of earlier
English collections. Among these is <i>Tommy
Thumb's Song Book for all Little Masters and
Misses</i>, by Nurse Lovechild, which is dated 1788,
and was printed by Isaiah Thomas at Worcester,
Mass. A copy is at the British Museum.</p>

<p>Isaiah Thomas was in direct connection with
England, where he procured, in 1786, the first
fount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
 of music type that was carried to America.
Among many toy-books of his that are reprints
from English publications, he issued <i>Mother Goose's
Melody, Sonnets for the Cradle</i>. A copy of this
book which is designated as the third Worcester
edition, bears the date 1799, and has been reprinted
in facsimile by Whitmore. It was probably
identical with the collection of rhymes for
which the firm of Newberry received copyright
in 1780, and which was mentioned by Ritson.
Other copies of <i>Mother Goose's Melody</i>, one bearing
the watermark of 1803, and the other issued
by the firm of John Marshall, which is undated,
are now at the Bodleian.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Thus the name of
Mother Goose was largely used in connection
with nursery rhymes.</p>

<p>The second half of the eighteenth century
witnessed a great development in toy-book literature.
The leader of the movement was John
Newbery, a man of considerable attainments,
who sold drugs and literature, and who came
from Reading to London in 1744, and settled in
St. Paul's Churchyard, where his establishment
became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
 a famous centre of the book trade.
Among those whom he had in his employ were
Griffith Jones (d. 1786) and Oliver Goldsmith
(d. 1774), whose versatility and delicate humour
gave a peculiar charm to the books for children
which they helped to produce.</p>

<p>In London Newbery had a rival in John
Marshall, whose shop in Aldermary Churchyard
was known already in 1787 as the <i>Great A, and
Bouncing B Toy Factory</i>. This name was derived
from a current nursery rhyme on the alphabet,
which occurs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Great A, little a, Bouncing B,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The cat's in the cupboard, and she can't see. <br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1744, p. 22.)</span>
</div></div>


<p>A number of provincial publishers followed
their example. Among them were Thomas Saint,
in Newcastle, who between 1771 and 1774 employed
the brothers Bewick; Kendrew, in York;
Lumsden, in Glasgow; Drewey, in Derby;
Rusher, in Banbury; and others. The toy-books
that were issued by these firms have much likeness
to one another, and are often illustrated by
the same cuts. Most of them are undated.
Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
 the books issued by Rusher were <i>Nursery
Rhymes from the Royal Collections</i>, and <i>Nursery
Poems from the Ancient and Modern Poets</i>, which
contain some familiar rhymes in versions which
differ from those found elsewhere.</p>

<p>Besides these toy-book collections, there is a
large edition of <i>Gammer Gurton's Garland</i>, of the
year 1810, which contains the collections of 1783
with considerable additions. In the year 1826,
Chambers published his <i>Popular Rhymes of Scotland</i>,
which contained some fireside stories and
nursery rhymes, the number of which was considerably
increased in the enlarged edition of
1870. In the year 1842, Halliwell, under the
auspices of the Percy Society, issued the <i>Nursery
Rhymes of England</i>, which were reprinted in
1843, and again in an enlarged edition in 1846.
Three years later he supplemented this book by
a collection of <i>Popular Rhymes</i> which contain
many traditional game rhymes and many valuable
remarks and criticisms.</p>

<p>These books, together with the rhymes of
Gawler, and a collection of <i>Old Nursery Rhymes
with Tunes</i>, issued by Rimbault in 1864, exhaust
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
 collections of nursery rhymes which have
a claim on the attention of the student. Most
of their contents were subsequently collected and
issued by the firm of Warne &amp; Co., under the
title <i>Mother Goose's Nursery Rhymes, Tales and
Jingles</i>, of which the issue of 1890 contains over
seven hundred pieces. In the list which follows,
I have arranged these various collections of rhymes
in the order of their issue, with a few modern
collections that contain further rhymes. Of those
which are bracketed I have not succeeded in finding
a copy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="chap">EARLY REFERENCES</p>


<p class="cap noin">INDEPENDENTLY of these collections of
nursery rhymes, many rhymes are cited in
general literature. This yields a further clue to
their currency at a given period. Thus Rimbault
describes a book called <i>Infant Institutes, part the
first, or a Nurserical Essay on the Poetry Lyric
and Allegorical of the Earliest Ages</i>, 1797, perhaps
by B. N. Turner, the friend of Dr. Johnson,
which was intended to ridicule the Shakespeare
commentators (<i>N. &amp; Q.</i>, 5, 3, 441). In the
course of his argument, the author cites a number
of nursery rhymes.</p>

<p>Again, the poet Henry Carey, about the year
1720, ridiculed the odes addressed to children by
Ambrose Philips by likening these to a jumble
of nursery rhymes. In doing so he cited the
rhymes, "Namby Pamby Jack a Dandy," "London
Bridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
 is broken down," "Liar Lickspit,"
"Jacky Horner," "See-saw," and others, which
nowadays are still included among the ordinary
stock of our rhymes.</p>

<p>Again, in the year 1671, John Eachard, the
divine, illustrated his argument by quoting the
alphabet rhyme "A was an apple pie," as far as
"G got it."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Instances such as these do not, however,
carry us back farther than the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>Another clue to the date of certain rhymes is
afforded by their mention of historical persons,
in a manner which shows that the rhyme in this
form was current at the time when the individual
whom they mention was prominently before the
eyes of the public. Halliwell recorded from oral
tradition the following verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Doctor Sacheverel<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Did very well,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">But Jacky Dawbin<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Gave him a warning.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1849, p. 12.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>The verse refers to Dr. Sacheverel, the nonconformist
minister who preached violent sermons in
St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
 Paul's, pointing at the Whig members as false
friends and real enemies of the Church. John
Dolben (1662-1710) called attention to them in
the House of Commons, and they were declared
"malicious, scandalous, and seditious libels."</p>

<p>Again there is the rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Lucy Locket lost her pocket,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Kitty Fisher found it,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">But the devil a penny was there in it,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Except the binding round it.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1849, p. 48.)</span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">This is said to preserve the names of two
celebrated courtesans of the reign of Charles II
(1892, p. 330).</p>

<p>The first name in the following rhyme is that
of a famous border hero who was hanged between
1529 and 1530:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Johnny Armstrong killed a calf;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Peter Henderson got half;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Willy Wilkinson got the head,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Ring the bell, the calf is dead.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1890, p. 358.)</span>
</div></div>



<p>Among the pieces collected by Halliwell, and
told in cumulative form, one begins and ends
with the following line, which recurs at the end
of every verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">John Ball shot them all.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Halliwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
 is of opinion that this may refer to
the priest who took a prominent part in the
rebellion at the time of Richard II, and who was
hanged, drawn, and quartered in 1381.</p>

<p>But a historical name does not necessarily
indicate the date of a rhyme. For a popular
name is sometimes substituted for one that has
fallen into contempt or obscurity. Moreover, a
name may originally have indicated a person
other than the one with whom it has come to be
associated.</p>

<p>A familiar nursery song printed in the collection
of c. 1783, and extant in several variants, is
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">When good King Arthur rul'd the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">He was a goodly king,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">He stole three pecks of barley meal<br /></span>
<span class="i5">To make a bag pudding.<br /></span>
<span class="i5">A bag pudding the king did make<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And stuff'd it well with plumbs,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And in it put great lumps of fat,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">As big as my two thumbs.<br /></span>
<span class="i5">The king and queen did eat thereof,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And noblemen beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And what they could not eat that night<br /></span>
<span class="i5">The queen next morning fry'd.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(<i>c.</i> 1783, p. 32.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Chappell, as cited by Halliwell, considered
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
 this version is not the correct one, but the
one which begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">King Stephen was a worthy king<br /></span>
<span class="i6">As ancient bards do sing....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The same story related in one verse only, and
in simpler form, connects it with Queen Elizabeth,
in a version recovered in Berkshire.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Our good Quane Bess, she maayde a pudden,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">An stuffed un well o' plumes;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And in she put gurt dabs o' vat,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">As big as my two thumbs. <br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1892, p. 289.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>On the face of it the last variant appears to be
the oldest.</p>

<p>An interesting example of a change of name,
and of the changing meaning of a name, is
afforded by the nursery song that is told of
King Arthur, and <i>mutatis mutandis</i> of Old King
Cole. The poem of King Arthur is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">When Arthur first in Court began<br /></span>
<span class="i5">To wear long hanging sleeves,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">He entertained three serving men<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And all of them were thieves.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">The first he was an Irishman,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">The second was a Scot,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">The third he was a Welshman,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And all were knaves, I wot.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
<span class="i5">The Irishman loved usquebaugh,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">The Scot loved ale called blue-cap.<br /></span>
<span class="i5">The Welshman he loved toasted cheese,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And made his mouth like a mouse-trap.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Usquebaugh burnt the Irishman,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">The Scot was drowned in ale,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">The Welshman had liked to be choked by a mouse,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">But he pulled it out by the tail.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In this form the piece is designated as a glee,
and is printed in the <i>New Lyric</i> by Badcock of
about 1720, which contains "the best songs now
in vogue."</p>

<p>In the nursery collection of Halliwell of 1842
there is a parallel piece to this which stands as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Old King Cole was a merry old soul<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And a merry old soul was he;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Old King Cole he sat in his hole,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And he called for his fiddlers three.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">The first he was a miller,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The second he was a weaver,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The third he was a tailor,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And all were rogues together.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">The miller he stole corn,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The weaver he stole yarn,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The little tailor stole broadcloth<br /></span>
<span class="i6">To keep these three rogues warm.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
<span class="i6">The miller was drowned in his dam,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The weaver was hung in his loom,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The devil ran away with the little tailor<br /></span>
<span class="i6">With the broadcloth under his arm.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1842, p. 3.)</span>
</div></div>


<p>Chappell printed the words of the song of Old
King Cole in several variations, and pointed out
that <i>The Pleasant Historie of Thomas of Reading,
or the Six Worthie Yeomen of the West</i> of 1632,
contains the legend of one Cole, a cloth-maker of
Reading at the time of King Henry I, and that
the name "became proverbial owing to the popularity
of this book." "There was some joke or
conventional meaning among Elizabethan dramatists,"
he says, "when they gave the name of
Old Cole, which it is now difficult to recover."
Dekker in the <i>Satiromatrix</i> of 1602, and Marston
in <i>The Malcontent</i> of 1604, applied the name to
a woman. On the other hand, Ben Jonson in
<i>Bartholomew Fair</i> gave the name of Old Cole to
the sculler in the puppet-play <i>Hero and Leander</i>
which he there introduces.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> In face of this information,
what becomes of the identity of the
supposed king?</p>

<p>On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
 the other hand a long ancestry is now claimed
for certain characters of nursery fame who seemed
to have no special claim to attention. The
following verse appears in most collections of
rhymes, and judging from the illustration which
accompanies it in the toy-books, it refers sometimes
to a boy and a girl, sometimes to two boys.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Jack and Gill went up the hill<br /></span>
<span class="i6">To fetch a bottle of water;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Jack fell down and broke his crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And Gill came tumbling after.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(<i>c.</i> 1783, p. 51.)<br /></span>
<span class="i6 pt">[Later collections have <i>Jill</i> and <i>pail</i>.]<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>This verse, as was first suggested by Baring-Gould,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
preserves the Scandinavian myth of the
children Hjuki and Bill who were caught up by
Mani, the Moon, as they were taking water from
the well Byrgir, and they can be seen to this day
in the moon carrying the bucket on the pole
between them.</p>

<p>Another rhyme cited by Halliwell from <i>The
New Mad Tom o'Bedlam</i> mentions Jack as being
the Man in the Moon:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
<span class="i4">The Man in the Moon drinks claret,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But he is a dull Jack-a-dandy;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Would he know a sheep's head from a carrot,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He should learn to drink cider or brandy.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1842, p. 33.)</span>
</div></div>


<p>According to North German belief, a man
stands in the moon pouring water out of a pail
(K., p. 304), which agrees with expressions such as
"the moon holds water." In a Norse mnemonic
verse which dates from before the twelfth century,
we read, "the pail is called Saeg, the
pole is called Simul, Bil and Hiuk carry them"
(C. P., I, 78).</p>

<p>The view that Jack and Jill are mythological
or heroic beings finds corroboration in the expression
"for Jak nor for Gille," which occurs in
the Townley Mysteries of about the year 1460.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
By this declaration a superhuman power is called
in as witness. The same names are coupled
together also in an ancient divination rhyme used
to decide in favour of one of two courses of
action. Two scraps of paper slightly moistened
were placed on the back of the hand, and the
following invocation was pronounced before and
after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
 breathing upon them to see which would fly
first. The sport was taught by Goldsmith to Miss
Hawkins when a child, as she related to Forster.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">There were two blackbirds sat upon a hill<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The one was named Jack, the other named Jill.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Fly away Jack! Fly away Jill!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Come again Jack! Come again Jill!<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1810, p. 45.)</span>
</div></div>


<p>The lines suggest the augur's action with regard
to the flight of birds. The same verse has been
recited to me in the following variation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Peter and Paul sat on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Fly away Peter! Fly away Paul!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Come again Peter! Come again Paul!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">In this case the names of Christian apostles have
been substituted for heathen names which, at
the time when the <i>names</i> were changed, may still
have carried a suggestion of profanity. The
following rhyme on Jack and Gill occurs in an
early nursery collection:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">I won't be my father's Jack,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">I won't be my mother's Gill,<br /></span>

<span class="i6">And have music when I will.<br /></span>

<p class="chap">RHYMES AND POPULAR SONGS</p>


<p class="cap noin">ON looking more closely at the contents of
our nursery collections, we find that a large
proportion of so-called nursery rhymes are songs
or snatches of songs, which are preserved also as
broadsides, or appeared in printed form in early
song-books. These songs or parts of songs were
included in nursery collections because they happened
to be current at the time when these
collections were made, and later compilers transferred
into their own collections what they found
in earlier ones. Many songs are preserved in a
number of variations, for popular songs are in
a continual state of transformation. Sometimes
new words are written to the old tune, and
differ from those that have gone before in all but
the rhyming words at the end of the lines; sometimes
new words are introduced which entirely
change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
 the old meaning. Many variations of
songs are born of the moment, and would pass
away with it, were it not that they happen to be
put into writing and thereby escape falling into
oblivion.</p>

<p>In <i>Mother Goose's Melody</i> stands a song in six
verses which begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">There was a little man who woo'd a little maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And he said: "Little maid, will you wed, wed, wed?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I have little more to say, will you? Aye or nay?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For little said is soonest mended, ded, ded."<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1799, p. 46.)</span>
</div></div>


<p class="noin">Halliwell's collection includes only the first and
the fourth verse of this piece. (1842, p. 24.)</p>

<p>In the estimation of Chappell this song was
a very popular ballad, which was sung to the
tune of <i>I am the Duke of Norfolk</i>, or <i>Paul's
Steeple</i>.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It appears also in the <i>Fairing or Golden
Toy for Children of all Sizes and Denominations</i>
of 1781, where it is designated as "a new love
song by the poets of Great Britain." Its words
form a variation of the song called <i>The Dumb
Maid</i>, which is extant in a broadside of about
1678,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">
[15]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
 and which is also included in the early
collection of <i>Pills to Purge Melancholy</i> of 1698-1719.
The likeness between the pieces depends
on their peculiar repeat:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">There was a bonny blade had married a country maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And safely conducted her home, home, home;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She was neat in every part, and she pleased him to the heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But alas, and alas, she was dumb, dumb, dumb.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The same form of verse was used in another
nursery song which stands as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">There was a little man, and he had a little gun,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the ball was made of lead, lead, lead.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he went to a brook to shoot at a duck,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he hit her upon the head, head, head.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then he went home unto his wife Joan,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To bid her a good fire to make, make, make,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To roast the duck that swam in the brook,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he would go fetch her the drake, drake, drake.<br /></span>
<span class="smallind">(1744, p. 43; with repeat, 1810, p. 45.)</span>
</div></div>


<p>Again, a song which appears in several early
nursery collections is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">There was an old woman toss'd in a blanket,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Seventeen times as high as the moon;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But where she was going no mortal could tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For under her arm she carried a broom.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
<span class="i3">"Old woman, old woman, old woman," said I,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"Whither, ah whither, ah whither, so high?"<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To sweep the cobwebs from the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And I'll be with you by and by.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(<i>c.</i> 1783, p. 22.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>This song was a favourite with Goldsmith, who
sang it to his friends at dinner on the day when
his play <i>The Good-natured Man</i> was produced.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
It was one of the numerous songs that were sung
to the tune of Lilliburlero, which goes back at
least to the time of Purcell.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> A Scottish version
of this piece was printed by Chambers, which
presents some interesting variations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">There was a wee wifie row't up in a blanket,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Nineteen times as hie as the moon;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And what did she there I canna declare,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For in her oxter she bure the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"Wee wifie, wee wifie, wee wifie," quo' I,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"O what are ye doin' up there sae hie?"<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"I'm blowin' the cauld cluds out o' the sky."<br /></span>
<span class="i3">"Weel dune, weel dune, wee wifie!" quo' I.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1870, p. 34.)</span>
</div></div>


<p>I have come across a verse sung on Earl Grey
and Lord Brougham, written in 1835, which may
have been in imitation of this song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
<span class="i3">Mother Bunch shall we visit the moon?<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Come, mount on your broom, I'll stick on a spoon,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Then hey to go, we shall be there soon ... etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mother Bunch is a familiar character of British
folk-lore, who figures in old chapbooks as a keeper
of old-world saws, and gives advice in matters
matrimonial. One of the earliest accounts of her
is <i>Pasquill's Jests with the Merriments of Mother
Bunch</i>, extant in several editions, which was
reprinted by Hazlitt in <i>Old English Jestbooks</i>,
1864, Vol. III. There are also <i>Mother Bunch's
Closet newly broke open</i>, <i>Mother Bunch's Golden
Fortune Teller</i>, and <i>Mother Bunch's Fairy Tales</i>,
published by Harris in 1802. The name also
occurs in <i>Mother Osborne's Letter to the Protestant
Dissenters rendered into English Metre by Mother
Bunch</i>, 1733. Mother Bunch, like Mother Goose
and Mother Shipton, may be a traditional name,
for Mother Bunch has survived in connections
which suggest both the wise woman and the
witch.</p>

<p>Another old song which figures in early nursery
collections is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
<span class="i6">What care I how black I be?<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Twenty pounds will marry me;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">If twenty won't, forty shall&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">I am my mother's bouncing girl.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(<i>c.</i> 1783, p. 57.)</span>
</div></div>


<p>Chappell mentions a song called, <i>What care I
how fair she be</i>, which goes back to before 1620.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
The words of these songs seem to have suggested
a parody addressed to Zachary Macaulay, the
father of the historian, who pleaded the cause of
the slaves. The Bill for the abolition of slavery
was passed in 1833, and the following quatrain
was sung with reference to it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">What though now opposed I be?<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Twenty peers will carry me.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">If twenty won't, thirty will,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">For I'm His Majesty's bouncing Bill.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(<i>N. &amp; Q.</i>, 8, XII, 48.)</span>
</div></div>


<p>Another so-called nursery rhyme which is no
more than a popular song has been traced some
way back in history by Halliwell, who gives it in
two variations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Three blind mice, see how they run!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">They all run after the farmer's wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Who cut off their tails with a carving knife,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Did you ever see such fools in your life&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Three blind mice!<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1846, p. 5.)</span>
</div></div>


<p>In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
 <i>Deuteromalia</i> of 1609 this stands as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Three blind mice, three blind mice!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Dame Julian, the miller and his merry old wife<br /></span>
<span class="i4">She scrapte the tripe, take thow the knife.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among the popular songs which have found
their way into nursery collections is the one
known as <i>A Frog he would a wooing go</i>, the
subject of which is old. Already in 1549 the
shepherds of Scotland sang a song called, <i>The
Frog cam to the Myldur</i>. In the year 1580 there
was licensed, <i>A most strange Wedding of the Frog
and the Mouse</i>, as appears from the books of the
Stationers' Company cited by Warton.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The
song has been preserved in many variations with
a variety of burdens. These burdens sound like
nonsense, but in some cases the same words
appear elsewhere in a different application, which
shows that they were not originally unmeaning.</p>

<p>The oldest known version of the song begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was a frog in the well, <i>humble dum, humble dum</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the mouse in the mill, <i>tweedle tweedle twino</i>.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
 expression <i>humble dum</i> occurs in other
songs and seems to indicate triumph; the word
<i>tweedle</i> represents the sound made by the pipes.</p>

<p>A Scottish variation of the song begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There lived a Puddy in a well, <i>Cuddy alone, Cuddy alone</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lived a Puddy in a well, <i>Cuddy alone and I</i>.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the nursery collection of <i>c.</i> 1783 the song
begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was a frog liv'd in a well, <i>Kitty alone, Kitty alone</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a frog liv'd in a well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a frog liv'd in a well, <i>Kitty alone and I</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a farce mouse in a mill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Cock me cary, Kitty alone, Kitty alone and I</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(<i>c.</i> 1783, p. 4.)</span>
</div></div>


<p>The origin and meaning of this burden remains
obscure.</p>

<p>The antiquity and the wide popularity of these
verses are further shown by a song written in
imitation of it, called <i>A Ditty on a High Amore
at St. James</i>, and set to a popular tune, which
dates from before 1714. It is in verse, and
begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Great Lord Frog and Lady Mouse, <i>Crackledom hee, crackledom ho</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwelling near St. James' house, <i>Cocki mi chari chi</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode to make his court one day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the merry month of May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the sun shone bright and gay, <i>twiddle come, tweedle dee</i>.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the accepted nursery version the song
begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A frog he would a wooing ride, <i>heigho, says Rowley</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether his mother would let him or no,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With a roly-poly, gammon and spinach</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Heigho, says Anthony Rowley</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This burden is said by a correspondent of
<i>Notes and Queries</i> to have been first inserted in
the old song as a burden by Liston. His song,
entitled <i>The Love-sick Frog</i>, with an original tune
by C. E. H., Esq. (perhaps Charles Edward Horn),
and an accompaniment by Thomas Cook, was
published by Goulding &amp; Co., Soho Square, in
the early part of the nineteenth century (<i>N. &amp;
Q.</i>, I, 458). The burden has been traced back
to the <i>jeu d'esprit</i> of 1809 on the installation of
Lord Grenville as Chancellor of Oxford, which
another correspondent quotes from memory:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Mister Chinnery then an M. A. of great parts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sang the praises of Chancellor Grenville.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! He pleased all the ladies and tickled their hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then we all know he's a Master of Arts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With a rowly, powly, gammon and spinach</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Heigh ho! says Rowley.</i><br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(<i>N. &amp; Q.</i>, 11, 27.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Another variation of the song of <i>The Frog
and the Mouse</i> of about 1800 begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was a frog lived in a well, <i>heigho, crowdie</i>!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a merry mouse in a mill, <i>with a howdie, crowdie</i>, etc.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(<i>N. &amp; Q.</i>, 11, 110.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>This expression, <i>heigho, crowdie</i>, contains a call
to the crowd to strike up. The crowd is the
oldest kind of British fiddle, which had no neck
and only three strings. It is mentioned as a
British instrument already by the low Latin
poet Fortunatus towards the close of the sixth
century: "Chrotta Britannia canat." The instrument
is well known to this day in Wales as the
<i>crwth</i>.</p>

<p>The word crowdy occurs also as a verb in one
of the numerous nursery rhymes referring to
scenes of revelry, at which folk-humour pictured
the cat making music:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
<span class="i6">Come dance a jig to my granny's pig,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">With a rowdy, rowdy, dowdy;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Come dance a jig to my granny's pig,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And pussy cat shall crowdy.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1846, p. 141.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>This verse and a number of others go back to
the festivities that were connected with Twelfth
Night. Some of them preserve expressions in
the form of burdens which have no apparent
sense; in other rhymes the same expressions have
the force of a definite meaning. Probably the
verses in which the words retain a meaning have
the greater claim to antiquity.</p>

<p>Thus among the black-letter ballads is a song<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
which is found also in the nursery collection of
1810 under the designation <i>The Lady's Song in
Leap Year</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Roses are red, <i>diddle diddle</i>, lavender's blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If you will have me, <i>diddle diddle</i>, I will have you.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lillies are white, <i>diddle diddle</i>, rosemary's green,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When you are king, <i>diddle, diddle</i>, I will be queen.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Call up your men, <i>diddle, diddle</i>, set them to work,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some to the plough, <i>diddle, diddle</i>, some to the cart.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some to make hay, <i>diddle, diddle</i>, some to cut corn,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While you and I, <i>diddle, diddle</i>, keep the bed warm.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1810, p. 46.)</span>
</div></div>


<p>Halliwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
cites this song in a form in which the
words are put into the lips of the king, and
associates it with the amusements of Twelfth
Night:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Lavender blue, <i>fiddle faddle</i>, lavender green.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When I am king, <i>fiddle faddle</i>, you shall be queen, etc.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1849, p. 237.)</span>
</div></div>


<p>The expression <i>diddle diddle</i> according to
Murray's Dictionary means to make music without
the utterance of words, while <i>fiddle faddle</i>
is said to indicate nonsense, and to fiddle is to
fuss. But both words seem to go back to the
association of dancing, as is suggested by the
songs on Twelfth Night, or by the following
nursery rhyme which refers to the same celebration.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">A cat came fiddling out of the barn,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With a pair of bagpipes under her arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">She could sing nothing but fiddle cum fee,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The mouse has married the humble bee;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Pipe, cat, dance, mouse;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">We'll have a wedding in our good house.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1842, p. 102.)</span>
</div></div>


<p>The following variation of this verse occurs in
the <i>Nursery Songs</i> published by Rusher:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
<span class="i4">A cat came fiddling out of a barn,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With a pair of bagpipes under her arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">She sang nothing but fiddle-de-dee,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Worried a mouse and a humble bee.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Puss began purring, mouse ran away,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And off the bee flew with a wild huzza!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In both cases the cat was fiddling, that is
moving to instrumental music without the
utterance of words, and called upon the others
to do so while she played the pipes. Her
association with an actual fiddle, however, is
preserved in the following rhyme which I cite
in two of its numerous variations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Sing hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The cow jump'd over the moon!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The little dog laughed to see such sport,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And the dish lick't up the spoon.<br /></span>
<span class="midind">(1797, cited by Rimbault.)</span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Sing hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The cow jumped over the moon;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The little dog laughed to see such craft,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And the dish ran away with the spoon.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(<i>c.</i> 1783, p. 27.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>This rhyme also refers to the revelry which
accompanied a feast, probably the one of
Twelfth Night also.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="chap">RHYMES IN TOY-BOOKS</p>


<p class="cap noin">MANY of our longer nursery pieces first
appeared in print in the diminutive toy-books
already described, which represent so
curious a development in the literature of the
eighteenth century. These books were sometimes
hawked about in one or more sheets, which were
afterwards folded so as to form a booklet of
sixteen, thirty-two, or sixty-four pages. Others
were issued sewn and bound in brilliant covers, at
a cost of as much as a shilling or eighteen pence.
Usually each page contained one verse which was
illustrated by an appropriate cut. In the toy-books
which tell a consecutive story, the number
of verses of the several pieces seem to have been
curtailed or enlarged in order to fit the required
size of the book.</p>

<p>It is in these toy-books that we first come
across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
 famous nursery pieces such as the <i>Alphabet</i>
which begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">A was an Archer, who shot at a frog,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">B was a blind man, and led by a dog ... etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This first appeared in <i>A Little Book for Little
Children</i> by T. W., sold at the Ring in Little
Britain. It contains a portrait of Queen Anne,
and probably goes back to the early part of the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p><i>The Topbook of all</i>, already mentioned, which
is of about 1760, contains the oldest version
that I have come across of the words used
in playing <i>The Gaping, Wide-mouthed, Waddling
Frog</i>, each verse of which is illustrated by
a rough cut. Again, <i>The Tragic Death of
A, Apple Pie</i>, which, as mentioned above, was
cited as far back as 1671, forms the contents of a
toy-book issued by J. Evans about the year 1791
at the price of a farthing. <i>The Death and Burial
of Cock Robin</i> fills a toy-book which was
published by J. Marshall, London, and again by
Rusher at Banbury; both editions are undated.
Again <i>The Courtship, Marriage, and Picnic
Dinner of Cock Robin and Jenny Wren</i> form the
contents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
 of a toy-book dated 1810 and published
by Harris, and <i>The Life and Death of Jenny
Wren</i> appeared in a toy-book dated 1813, issued
by J. Evans.</p>

<p>Another famous toy-book contained <i>The Comic
Adventures of Old Mother Hubbard and her Dog</i>.
This story was first issued in toy-book form by
J. Harris, "successor to E. Newbery at the
corner of St. Paul's Churchyard," probably at the
beginning of 1806, at the cost of eighteen pence.
A copy of the second edition, which mentions the
date 1 May, 1806, is at the British Museum. It
contains the words "to T. B. Esquire, <span class="smcap">M.P.</span> county
of XX, at whose suggestion and at whose house
these notable sketches were first designed, this
volume is with all suitable deference dedicated by
his humble servant S. C. M." The coffin which is
represented in one of the cuts in the book bears
the initials S. C. M., and the date 1804. This
inscribing of the author's initials on a coffin is
quite in keeping with the tone of toy-book
literature.</p>

<p>In October, 1805, J. Harris had published
<i>Whimsical Incidents, or the Power of Music, a
poetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
 tale by a near relation of Old Mother Hubbard</i>,
which has little to recommend it, and contains
nothing on the dog. On its first page stands a
verse which figures independently as a nursery
rhyme in some later collections:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The cat was asleep by the side of the fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her mistress snor'd loud as a pig,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When Jack took the fiddle by Jenny's desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And struck up a bit of a jig.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1810, p. 33.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>J. Harris also published in March, 1806, <i>Pug's
Visit, or the Disasters of Mr. Punch</i>, a sequel
to the <i>Comic Adventures of Mother Hubbard
and her Dog</i>. This has a dedication framed
in the same style, "To P. A. Esquire ... by
his humble servant W. F."</p>

<p>The success of the <i>Comic Adventures of Mother
Hubbard and her Dog</i> was instantaneous and
lasting. In <i>The Courtship of Jenny Wren</i>, which
is dated 1810, while its cuts bear the date 1806,
Parson Rook is represented carrying "Mother
Hubbard's book," and a foot-note is added to the
effect that "upwards of ten thousand copies of
this celebrated work have been distributed in
various parts of the country in a few months."
The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
 <i>Comic Adventures</i> were read all over London
and in the provinces, both in the original and in
pirated editions, of which I have seen copies
issued by J. Evans of Long Lane, West Smithfield;
by W. S. Johnson of 60 St. Martin's Lane;
by J. Marshall of Aldermary Churchyard; and
by others. A very diminutive toy-book containing
verses of the tale of Mother Hubbard, illustrated
with rough cuts, is on view at South Kensington
Museum among the exhibits of A. Pearson. I do
not know its publisher.</p>

<p>The <i>Comic Adventures of Mother Hubbard</i> are
usually told in fourteen verses, which refer to the
dame's going to the cupboard, to her going for
bread, for a coffin, for tripe, beer, wine, fruit, a
coat, a hat, a wig, shoes, hose, and linen. The
story ends:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The dame made a curtsey, the dog made a bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dame said, "Your servant," the dog said "Bow-wow."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But some editions have an additional rhyme on
the dame's going for fish; and the edition at
South Kensington has the verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Old Mother Hubbard sat down in a chair,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And danced her dog to a delicate air;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She went to the garden to buy him a pippin,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When she came back the dog was skipping.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the edition of Rusher, instead of "the dog
made a bow," we read "Prin and Puss made a
bow."</p>

<p>In Halliwell's estimation the tale of Mother
Hubbard and her dog is of some antiquity, "were
we merely to judge," he says, "of the rhyme of
laughing to coffin in the third verse."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">She went to the undertaker's to buy him a coffin,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When she came back the poor dog was laughing.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">But it seems possible also that the author of
the poem had running in his mind a verse containing
this rhyme, which occurs already in the
<i>Infant Institutes</i> of 1797, where it stands as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was a little old woman and she liv'd in a shoe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had so many children, she didn't know what to do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She crumm'd 'em some porridge without any bread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she borrow'd a beetle, and she knock'd 'em all o' th' head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then out went the old woman to bespeak 'em a coffin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when she came back she found 'em all a-loffing.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
 piece contains curious mythological
allusions, as we shall see later.</p>

<p>It may be added that the nursery collection of
1810 (p. 37) contains the first verse only of
Mother Hubbard, which favours the view expressed
by Halliwell, that the compiler of the
famous book did not invent the subject nor the
metre of his piece, but wrote additional verses to
an older story.</p>

<p>The association of Mother Hubbard and the
dog may be relatively new, but the name Mother
Hubbard itself has some claim to antiquity. For
a political satire by Edmund Spenser was called
<i>Prosopopeia or Mother Hubberd's Tale</i>. It was
a youthful effort of the poet, and was soon forgotten.
In this piece "the good old woman was
height Mother Hubberd who did far surpass the
rest in honest mirth," and who related the fable
of the fox and the ape. Also Thomas Middleton
in 1604 published <i>Father Hubburd's Tale, or the
Ant and the Nightingale</i>, in the introduction to
which he addressed the reader as follows:&mdash;"Why
I call these Father Hubburd's tales, is not to have
them called in again as the Tale of Mother
Hubburd.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
 The world would shew little judgment
in that i' faith; and I should say then <i>plena stultorum
omnia</i>; for I entreat (<i>i.e.</i> treat) here
neither of rugged (<i>i.e.</i> ragged) bears or apes, no,
nor the lamentable downfall of the old wife's
platters&mdash;I deal with no such metal ... etc."</p>

<p>We do not know that Spenser's tale was
"called in again," nor does it mention ragged
bears and platters. Middleton must therefore
be referring to a different production to which
obstruction was offered by the public authorities.
In any case the name of Mother Hubburd, or
Hubbard, was familiar long before the publication
of the story of the dame and her dog.</p>

<p>Father Hubberd, who is mentioned by Middleton,
figures in nursery lore also. A rhyme is
cited which mentions him in connection with the
traditional cupboard:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">What's in the cupboard? says Mr Hubbard;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A knuckle of veal, says Mr Beal;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Is that all? says Mr Ball;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And enough too, says Mr Glue;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And away they all flew.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(<i>N. &amp; Q.</i>, 7, IV, 166.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Were they figured as cats?</p>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
 form of verse of this piece on Father
Hubbard reproduces the chiming of bells. The
same form of verse is used also in the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Fire! Fire!" says the town-crier;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"Where, where?" says Goody Blair;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"Down the town," said Goody Brown;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"I'll go and see't," said Goody Fleet,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"So will I," said Goody Fry.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1890, p. 315.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>The old play of <i>Ralph Roister Doister</i>, written
about the year 1550, ends with a "peele of bells
rung by the parish clerk," which is in the same
form of verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">First bell: When dyed he, when dyed he?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Second bell: We have him! We have him!<br /></span>

<p class="chap">RHYMES AND BALLADS</p>


<p class="cap noin">VARIOUS nursery pieces deal with material
which forms the subject of romantic ballads
also. Romantic ballads, like popular songs, are
preserved in a number of variations, for they were
sung again and again to suit the modified taste of
succeeding ages. Many romantic ballads retain
much that is pre-Christian in disposition and
sentiment. The finest collection of romantic
ballads during recent times was made by Child,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
who included the fireside versions of ballads that
have come down to us through nursery literature.
Child puts forward the opinion that where
we are in possession of a romantic and a fireside
version of the same ballad, the latter is a late and
degraded survival. But this hardly seems probable,
considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
 that the nursery version of the
tale is usually simpler in form, and often consists
of dialogue only.</p>

<p>In the estimation of Gregory Smith, the oldest
extant examples of romantic ballads "do not date
further back than the second and third quarter
of the fifteenth century" (that is between 1425
and 1475), "since the way in which the incidents
in these are presented, reflects the taste of that
age."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> This applies to romantic ballads that are
highly complex in form. The fireside version of
the same story may have flowed from the same
source. The question hangs together with that
of the origin of the ballad, which may have
arisen in connection with dancing and singing,
but the subject needs investigation.</p>

<p>Among our famous early ballads is that of <i>The
Elfin Knight</i>, the oldest printed copy of which is
of 1670.</p>

<p>It begins as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">My plaid awa', my plaid awa',<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And o'er the hill and far awa',<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And far awa' to Norrowa,<br /></span><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
<span class="i6">My plaid shall not be blown awa'.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The Elfin Knight sits on yon hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Ba, ba, ba, lilli ba,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">He blaws his horn both loud and shrill,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The wind has blawn my plaid awa',<br /></span>
<span class="i6">He blows it east, he blows it west,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">He blows it where he liketh best.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The ballad goes on to describe how problems
were bandied between the Elfin Knight and a
lady. The one on whom an impossible task was
imposed stood acquitted if he devised a task of no
less difficulty, which must first be performed by
his opponent. Such flytings go far back in
literature. In this case the Elfin Knight staked
his plaid, that is his life, on receiving the favour
of the lady, and he propounded to her three
problems, viz. of making a sack without a seam,
of washing it in a well without water, and of
hanging it to dry on a tree that never blossomed.
In reply, she claimed that he should plough an
acre of land with a ram's horn, that he should
sow it with a peppercorn, and that he should
reap it with a sickle of leather. The problems
perhaps had a recondite meaning, and the ballad-monger
probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
 found them ready to hand.
For Child cites a version of the ballad in which
the same flyting took place between a woman
and "the auld, auld man," who threatened to
take her as his own, and who turned out to be
Death. The idea of a wooer staking his life on
winning a lady is less primitive than that of
Death securing a victim.</p>

<p>The same tasks without their romantic setting
are preserved in the form of a simple dialogue, in
the nursery collections of <i>c.</i> 1783 and 1810. In
this case also it is the question of a wooer.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8"><i>Man speaks.</i><br /></span>

<span class="i4">And you shall be a true lover of mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Can you wash it in yonder well? Parsley, etc.,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Where never spring water or rain ever fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Can you dry it on yonder thorn,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8"><i>Maiden speaks.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Now you have asked me questions three,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I hope you will answer as many for me.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Can you find me an acre of land,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Between the salt water and the sea sand?<br /></span><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
<span class="i4">Can you plow it with a ram's horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And sow it all over with peppercorn?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Can you reap it with a sickle of leather,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And bind it up with a peacock's feather?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">When you have done and finished your work,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then come to me for your cambrick shirt.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(<i>c.</i> 1783, p. 10.)</span>
</div></div>


<p>On the face of it, it hardly seems likely that
this version is descended from the romantic
ballad.</p>

<p>The tasks that are here imposed on the man
are set also in the form of a boast in a nursery
song, in which they have so entirely lost their
meaning as to represent a string of impossibilities.</p>

<span class="i4">And sowed it with one pepper corn.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I harrowed it with a bramble bush,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And reaped it with a little pen knife.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I got the mice to carry it to the mill,<br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
 nursery piece is recorded by Halliwell
which, in simple form relates concerning <i>Billy
my son</i> the sequence of events which underlies
the famous romantic ballad of Lord Randal.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
The story is current also in Scotland relating
to <i>The Croodin Doo</i> (1870, p. 51); it was told
also some eighty years ago in Lincolnshire, of
<i>King Henry my son</i> (<i>N. &amp; Q.</i>, 8, VI, 427). The
romantic ballad in five verses, as told of Lairde
Rowlande, relates how he came from the woods
weary with hunting and expecting death. He
had been at his true love's, where he ate of the
food which poisoned his warden and his dogs. In
the nursery version the tragedy is told in the
following simple form:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Where have you been to-day, Billy my son?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Where have you been to-day, my only man?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I've been a wooing, mother; make my bed soon,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For I'm sick at heart, and fain would lie down.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">What have you ate to-day, Billy my son?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">What have you ate to-day, my only man?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I've eat eel pie, mother; make my bed soon,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For I am sick at heart, and shall die before noon.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1849, p. 259.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
 nursery pieces deal with Tommy Linn,
the Tam Linn of romance, who is the hero of many
famous romantic ballads. The name of Tam Linn
goes some way back in history. For the <i>Tayl of
young Tamlene</i>, according to Vedderburn's <i>Complaint
of Scotland</i>, of 1549, was told among a
company of shepherds, and the name appears
also as that of a dance, <i>A Ballett of Thomalyn</i>,
as far back as 1558.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>According to the romantic ballads, Tam Linn
fell under the influence of the fairies through
sleeping under an apple tree, and they threatened
to take him back as their own on Hallowe'en,
when they rode abroad once in seven years and
had the right to claim their due. Tam Linn told
the woman who loved him that she must hold
him fast, whatever shape he assumed owing to
the enchantment of the witches, and that she
must cast him into water as soon as he assumed
the shape of a <i>gled</i>. He would then be restored
to human form.</p>

<p>Tam Linn of romance figures in nursery lore
as Tommy Linn. His exploits were printed by
Halliwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
 in one of the numerous versions that
are current in the north. In these pieces Tommy
Linn has only this in common with Tam Linn of
romance, that he too is ready with a suggestion
whatever mishap befalls.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
 short nursery rhymes are taken from
this, or other versions of this poem. Among the
pieces printed by Chambers we read&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott in <i>Redgauntlet</i> cites a catch
on <i>Sir Thom o' Lyne</i>.</p>

Tommy Lin, the Scotchman, are appropriated to
Bryan O'Lin, the Irishman.</p>

<p>Many nursery rhymes which dwell on cats are
formed on the model of these verses. A rhyme
that comes from America is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
<span class="i4">Kit and Kitterit and Kitterit's mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">All went over the bridge together.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The bridge broke down, they all fell in,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"Good luck to you," says Tom Bolin.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A modern collection of rhymes (1873, p. 136)
gives this as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">The two grey cats and the grey kits' mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">All went over the bridge together;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The bridge broke down, they all fell in,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">May the rats go with you, sings Tom Bowlin.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The association of cats with Tommy Linn
reappears in the rhyme in which Tommy, who in
the romantic ballad begged immersion for himself,
practised immersion on a cat. Perhaps the cat
was figured as a witch, who, being suspected, was
cast into the water in order to prove her witchcraft.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Ding dong bell, poor pussy has fall'n i' th' well,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">To drown poor pussy cat,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">But catch'd a mouse i' th' barn.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1797, cited by Rimbault.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Other variations of this rhyme mention Johnny
Green (<i>c.</i> 1783, p. 23) and Tommy Quin (Rusher),
which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
 considering the relative antiquity of
Tommy Linn, are obvious degradations of this
name.</p>

<p>The rhyme in some collections is quoted in an
enlarged form:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Who put her in? Little Tommy Lin,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Who pulled her out? Little Tommy [<i>or</i> Dickey] Stout.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I have heard also:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Who put her in? Little Tommy Thin.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Who pulled her out? Little Tommy Stout.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Stout is perhaps a traditional name. For it
occurs in the nursery piece on the old woman who
went to sleep out of doors and forgot her identity.
I know no earlier version of this piece in English
than the one recorded by Rimbault which begins:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">There was a little woman as I've heard tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Who went to market her eggs for to sell.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">It further relates how she went to sleep out of
doors, how the man Stout "cut her petticoats
round about," and how on waking she did not
know herself, and decided to go home and find
out if her dog knew her (1864, p. 6). But the
story is an old one, for we come across it in
Grimm's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
 <i>Fairy Tales</i>, where it forms a sequel to
"Kluge Else," (No. 35). In this the part of Stout
is taken by the woman's husband, who hung her
skirt about with bells, and it is further stated that
the woman fell asleep when she was cutting corn.
The same story in a more interesting form was
recovered in Norway. Here we read that the
woman fell asleep while she was cutting hemp,
which explains why her mind failed her. For
hemp newly cut has strongly narcotic properties.
It was probably the herb which the witches
smoked in their diminutive clay-pipes in pre-Christian
times. Presumably on account of these
narcotic properties sowing and cutting of hemp
were associated all over Europe with peculiar
dances, such as <i>Enfille aiguille</i>, our <i>Thread-the-Needle</i>.
Its connection with heathen rites of divination
is suggested by the well-known rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Hemp-seed I set, hemp-seed I sow,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The young man whom I love,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Come after me and mow.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1890, p. 414.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>In this form the rhyme is also cited in <i>Mother
Bunch's Closet newly broke open</i>, as a charm to
secure the vision of one's future husband.</p>

<p class="chap">RHYMES AND COUNTRY DANCES</p>


<p class="cap noin">MANY true nursery rhymes go back to traditional
dancing and singing games which
are now relegated to the playground, but which
were danced by rustics within the memory of
man, and which are heirs to the choral dances of
our heathen forefathers. For dancing in its origin
was no idle and unmeaning pastime. Dances
were undertaken for serious purposes, such as
warding off evil and promoting agricultural
growth, conceptions which hang closely together.
These dances formed part of festivities that took
place at certain times of the year. They were
accompanied by expressive words, and by actions
which were suited to the words, and which gave
the dance a dramatic character. Our carol is
related to the <i>caraula</i> that was prohibited among
heathen customs by Bishop Eligius of Noyon
(d. 659),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
 in the north of France in the seventh
century, and has the same origin as the <i>Choreia</i>
of the Greeks, the <i>reihe</i> or <i>reigen</i> of Germany,
the <i>karol</i> of Brittany, and the <i>caraula</i> of eastern
Switzerland. In course of time the religious
significance of the choral dance was lost and its
practice survived as a sport. At a later stage
still, it became a pastime of children and a diversion
of the ballroom.</p>

<p>Among the dances that can be traced back
through several stages, is the one which in its
latest survival is known as the <i>Cotillon</i>. This is
mentioned in England as far back as the year 1766.
Burns in <i>Tam o' Shanter</i> speaks of it as "brand
new from France." The peculiar features of the
Cotillon as it is danced nowadays, include free
choice of partners, the women being at liberty in
one figure to choose the men, the drawing into
the dance of the assembled company, and the
presence of a cushion which is put to a variety
of uses. The Cotillon usually concludes the
ball.</p>

<p>In an earlier form the Cotillon is represented
by the dance which was known in the seventeenth
century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
 as <i>Joan Saunderson or the Cushion Dance</i>.
The way of dancing <i>Joan Saunderson</i> is described
in <i>The Dauncing Master, a collection of dances
with tunes for young people</i>, published by
H. Playford. Of this the first volume was
issued in 1650, which was enlarged in subsequent
editions, when further volumes were added.
<i>The Dauncing Master</i> of Playford shows how
traditional country dances were appropriated to
the ballroom, for many of these dance tunes,
such as <i>Mulberry Bush</i>, and <i>Green Sleeves</i>, correspond
with the names of traditional dancing and
singing games.</p>

<p>In <i>Joan Saunderson or the Cushion Dance</i> as
described by Playford,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> a cushion and a drinking-horn
were brought in by two dancers to the sound
of a fiddle. The cushion-bearer locked the door
and pocketed the key, and danced round the room
alone. Then he exchanged words with the fiddler
as to the need of finding a maid and pressing her
into the dance. The name Joan Saunderson
being proposed, the cushion-bearer placed the
cushion before the woman of his choice, and
knelt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
 upon it. She did the same, and drank
from the horn. They kissed and danced together.
The same ceremony was then gone through by
the girl, who, when the name John Saunderson
was proposed, approached the man of her choice
bearing the cushion, the first dancer accompanying
her. The ceremony was repeated again and
again, alternately by man and woman, and as
each dancer chose a partner, the number of those
following the cushion-bearer increased. Finally
the whole assembled company were drawn into
the ring.</p>

<p>A scene in <i>Joan Saunderson</i> is said to be represented
in a Dutch engraving of the year 1624
(1876, p. 254). <i>Joan Saunderson</i> is still danced
in different parts of the country under the same
or some similar name. In Derbyshire it is known
as the <i>Cushion Dance</i>, and those who are drawn
into the ring are addressed as John Sanders and
Jane Sanders. In the Lowlands the dance is
known as <i>Babbity Bowster</i>, bowster standing for
bolster; in the north it is the <i>Whishin Dance</i>,
whishin standing for cushion (1894, I, pp. 9, 87).
The Cushion Dance was the last dance that was
danced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
 at a wedding,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and at Northampton it
came at the conclusion of the May-Day festival
(1876, p. 253).</p>

<p>In the Cotillon of the ballroom, the ring
finally breaks up and the company dances in
couples; the Cushion Dance leads up to the withdrawal
of the married pair, and concludes with
a romp. A later edition of <i>The Dauncing Master</i>
(1698, p. 7), perhaps with a view to forestalling
this, adds a sequel to the dance, according to
which the game, after it had been wound, was
unwound, that is, each dancer in turn bade farewell
to his partner, and after doing so left the
room.</p>

<p>The points of likeness between the Cotillon
and the Cushion Dance are such as to favour
the belief that they are connected. The free
choice of partners, the presence of the cushion,
the drawing in of the whole assembled company,
and the fact that the dance terminates the ball,
are peculiar to them both. The Cushion Dance
being the older sport, preserves the association
with weddings and with the May-Day festival,
which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
 at one time was the occasion for mating
and marriage.</p>

<p>The associations with mating and marriage are
preserved also in a traditional game that is still
played throughout the greater part of England,
which is generally known as <i>Sally Waters</i>. The
verses recited in playing it render it probable that
the Cushion Dance is a later development of the
game known as <i>Sally Waters</i>.</p>

<p>In playing <i>Sally Waters</i> the players stand
in a ring, a boy and a girl alternately choose a
partner and seal the bond by joining hands, or by
kneeling, or by a kiss. The verses recited in
playing the game were first recorded by Halliwell
(1849, p. 133). Forty-nine further variations,
used in different parts of the kingdom in playing
the game, have been printed by Mrs. Gomme,
who classed this among marriage games, (1894,
II, 461). In the book of Playford the Cushion
Dance is called also <i>Joan Saunderson</i>, and those
who are pressed into the dance are designated as
Joan Saunderson and John Saunderson, or as
Jane Sanders and John Sanders. In playing the
game of <i>Sally Waters</i> similar names are used.
Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
 the children in Penzance stand in a ring
and sing the following verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Little Sally Sander sitting in the Sander,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Weeping and crying for her young man.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1894, No. 26.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>In playing the game in Liverpool they begin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Little Polly Sanders sits on the sand, etc.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(<i>Ibid.</i>, No. 42.)<br /></span>
</div></div>



<p>The verses used in Yorkshire begin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Little Alice Sander sat upon a cinder, etc.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(<i>Ibid.</i>, No. 31.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These names Sally Sander, Polly Sanders, etc.,
must be derived from the same source as Saunderson
and Sanders of the Cushion Dance. A host
of other rhymes current in the nursery deal with
the same theme, and are formed on the same
model. There is one step only from <i>little Sally
Sander</i> of Penzance, <i>little Polly Sanders</i> of
Liverpool, and <i>little Alice Sander who sat upon a
cinder</i>, to the following rhymes which are included
in different nursery collections. All these rhymes
describe a person sitting and waiting, and most
of them dwell on the idea of a seat or a cushion,
while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
 the allusion to matters matrimonial, being
unsuitable to children, is altogether dropped.</p>

<p>These verses as they here stand arranged, show
an increasing deviation from the words used in
playing the game of Sally Waters.</p>

<p>Tom Tucker and Jack Horner are names that
go some way back in history. For Brand states
that at the revels kept at St. John's College,
1 November, 1607, a Christmas Lord of the
Revels was chosen as Thomas Tucker.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> A dance

Tucker</i> also.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The name of Jacky Horner was familiar to
Carey about the year 1720, as mentioned above.
<i>Little Jack Horner</i> was a well-known tune, and
there is a direction in the Grub Street opera that
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
 chorus shall be sung to this melody.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> A
chapbook of the latter half of the eighteenth
century bears the title, <i>The Pleasant History of
Jack Horner, containing his Witty Tricks</i>, etc.
It cites the familiar rhyme, and further describes
the pranks that the hero played upon women.
This association and the name recall the expressions
<i>hornified</i>, that is a cuckold;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> <i>horning</i>, a mock

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="chap">THE GAME OF <i>SALLY WATERS</i></p>


<p class="cap noin">THE game of <i>Sally Waters</i> calls for further
comment. In this game, as already mentioned,
the players stand in a circle, boy and
girl alternately choose a partner, while the friends
stand around and chant the verses. In these lies
the interest of the game. For these words in
the fifty variations collected by Mrs. Gomme, all
give expression to the same sequence of ideas.
There is the call to Sally to go through the
ceremony of sprinkling the pan or watering the
can. This is followed by a chorus that urges
that a choice be made. When this is made and
sealed by joining hands, or by kneeling, or by
a kiss, the chorus utters wishes for a prosperous
union. Similar traits appear in the games known
as <i>Pretty Little Girl of Mine</i>, <i>The Lady of the
Mountain</i>, and <i>Kiss in the Ring</i>, which, in a less
pronounced form, give expression to the same ideas.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>The verses used in playing <i>Sally Waters</i> in
Dorsetshire are among the most meaningful, and
stand as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Sally, Sally Waters, sprinkle in the pan,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rise, Sally; rise, Sally, and choose a young man;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Choose [<i>or</i> bow] to the east, choose [<i>or</i> bow] to the west<br /></span>
<span class="i2">[<i>Or</i> choose for the best one, choose for the worst one],<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Choose the pretty girl [<i>or</i> young man] that you love best.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And now you're married, I wish you joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">First a girl and then a boy;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Seven years after son and daughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now young people, jump over the water.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1894, Nr. 1.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These verses and the fact that <i>Sally Waters</i>
is related to the Cushion Dance that is danced
at weddings, render it probable that <i>Sally Waters</i>
originated in a marriage celebration of heathen
times. The formula in the Dorsetshire version
of the game concludes with a direction to the
young couple to "jump over the water." In
the Somersetshire version the direction is "kiss
each other and come out of the water" (1894,
No. 3); in the Shropshire variation, "kiss and
shake hands and come out" (1894, No. 14); in
the London variation, "kiss before you go out
of the water." (Appendix.)</p>

<p>Dipping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
 was an accepted ceremonial during
heathen times, which recovered or revealed a
person's true identity as in the case of Tam Linn,
or of the suspected witch who was thrown into
the water. Dipping constituted part of definite
celebrations. For the ceremonial of "dipping"
formed part of the May-Day festival as it was
kept in Northampton, while in Cornwall the saying
is current: "The first of May is dipping day"
(1876, p. 235). May-Day was a great day for
contracting matrimonial alliances in the heathen
past, and is at present avoided because of its
riotous associations.</p>

<p>Judging from the verses used in playing Sally
Waters, the union between the parties was contracted
conditionally for seven years only. Seven
years are definitely mentioned in sixteen out of
fifty variations of the game. The same period is
mentioned also in fourteen out of the twenty-five
variations of the verses used in playing <i>Pretty
Little Girl of Mine</i>, and in three out of seven
variations of the verses used in playing <i>The Lady
on the Mountain</i>.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gomme, in discussing the game of Sally
Waters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
 cites various expressions which show that
the marriage vow is still popularly looked upon
as binding for a certain period only, sometimes
for seven years (1894, II, 177). I find this corroborated
by remarks I have gleaned from country-folk.
Thus a woman whose husband had gone
from her, after seven years felt justified in looking
upon him as dead, and had the bell tolled for
his funeral.</p>

<p>Time-reckoning by seven years goes far back in
history, and is still the rule in many legal
arrangements. Seven years of plenty succeeded
seven years of famine in Egypt. Once in seven
years the fairies rode out to claim their due.
Some festivities happened only once in seven
years. The curious custom of <i>bumping</i>, that is, of
two persons taking up by the arms any persons
whom they met, and swinging them to and fro,
was observed on Ganging Day (29 September)
once in seven years at Bishop's Stortford (1876,
p. 380). At Bradford also a septennial festival
was kept in honour of Jason and the Golden
Fleece and St. Blaize on 3 February (1876,
p. 60). Similarly a dance known as the Metzgersprung
was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
 danced at Munich once in seven years
to keep off the plague (Bo., p. 44).</p>

<p>The mention of seven years in the marriage
game may indicate that the marriage was broken
off after seven years if the stipulated conditions
failed to be fulfilled. These conditions were that
the children born of the union should include one
of either sex. Mrs. Gomme, in connection with
this stipulation, remarks that a marriage is still
popularly reckoned incomplete from which there
is not male and female offspring. She also points
out that the expression "choose for the best,
choose for the worst" of the marriage game, is
related to the words "for better, for worse" of
the vernacular portion of the English marriage
service. The expressions "worst and best," or
"wisest and best," occur in thirteen out of the
fifty versions of words; instead of these, "choose
east and choose west" occur in twenty-two out of
the fifty versions (1894, II, 168). It is difficult
to decide which is the more primitive form of the
verse; I fancy the latter.</p>

<p>The ceremony of choosing was led up to by
<i>sprinkling the pan</i>, which is mentioned in twenty-one
out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
 of fifty variations of the game; <i>watering
the can</i> stands in twelve others. The pan
was specially associated with women as housekeepers,
and, together with the cradle, is mentioned
as one of the first essentials in setting up house
in the game of <i>Wallflowers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Judging from the game of <i>Sally Waters</i> as
played in Bucks, a "mother" actually presided at
the game, who directed her daughters to sprinkle
the pan, and their being included among those
from whom a choice was made, depended on their
successfully doing so. To the words of the game
as played in Bucks, I have added in brackets an
indication how the words were probably distributed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="lmargin ps">
(Half chorus): <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Sally, Sally Walker, sprinkled in the pan.<br /></span>
(Other half):  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">What did she sprinkle for?<br /></span>
(Answer):      <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">For a young man.<br /></span>
(Mother):      <span class="hang2" style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Sprinkle, sprinkle daughter, and you shall have a cow.<br /></span><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
(Daughter): <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I cannot sprinkle, mother, because I don't know how.<br /></span>
(Mother):   <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Sprinkle, daughter, sprinkle, and you shall have a man.<br /></span>
(Daughter): <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I cannot sprinkle, mother, but I'll do the best I can.<br /></span>
(Chorus):   <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Pick and choose, but don't you pick me,<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 7em;"> Pick the fairest you can see.<br /></span>
(Man):      <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">The fairest that I can see is.... Come to me!<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1894, No. 23.)</span>
</p>

<p>This is followed by the usual marriage formula.</p>

<p>A similar dialogue is included amongst the
Nursery Rhymes of Halliwell, in which the
daughter is directed to whistle, a word which
formerly conveyed the idea of uttering imprecations
in a low voice, and which was condemned in
a woman since it marked her out for a witch.
The verse stands as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Whistle daughter, whistle, whistle for a cradle.<br /></span>

<p>If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
 the words used in playing <i>Sally Waters</i> are
analysed, it will be seen that the name Sally
occurs in forty-four out of fifty variations, and
that in twenty-four variations the name is associated
with water. It is combined with water especially
in the south and the south-west of England.
Away from this district we have the name Sally
Walker, in Shropshire, Bucks, Yorkshire, Scotland,
and Ireland; the name Sally Salter in Yorkshire
and Lincoln; the names Sally Sander in Penzance,
Polly Sanders in Liverpool, and so forth. Obviously,
Sally Waters is the oldest form of the
name. This view is accepted by Mrs. Gomme,
who was, however, at a loss to account for the wide
use of the name Sally Waters. But, in classing the
variations of words of the game according to the
reasonableness of their contents, she placed foremost
as most meaningful the verses that hailed
from Dorsetshire, Somerset, and Devonshire, where
the form Sally Waters is in use. It is to this
district, therefore, that we must turn for the
origin of the game of <i>Sally Waters</i>.</p>

<p>On turning to the history of the British past in
these districts, we find that the Romans when
they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
 came to Bath found this spot far famed for
its waters. The name by which they knew the
place was <i>Aquæ Solis</i>, but the word <i>Solis</i> did
not stand for the sun as a male divinity, but for
<i>Sul</i>, the presiding female divinity of the place.
For the Roman temple built at Bath was dedicated
to the goddess Sulis-Minerva, and the name Sul,
both with and without the name of Minerva,
occurs among the noted inscriptions.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> It was a
common practice with the Romans to couple the
name of one of their own divinities with that of
a local divinity, and Minerva, in her capacity of a
healing goddess, was here associated with Sul, the
female divinity of the waters. On the façade of
the temple a medallion is represented. Inside it
is the head of a goddess with her hair tied together
over her forehead, and a crescent moon is behind
her. The moon is an emblem which is not associated
with Minerva elsewhere, and the head on the
medallion must therefore represent Sul. Sul was
the presiding divinity at Bath, and an altar was
also discovered which was dedicated to the Sulevæ.</p>

<p>A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
 similar altar has been discovered at Nismes,
which is dedicated to <i>Suliviæ Idennicæ Minervæ</i>.
Scarth, in his history of Roman Bath, cites Mr.
Roach Smith on these Sulevæ, who "appear to
have been sylphs, the tutelary divinities of rivers,
fountains, hills, roads, villages and other localities
against whom were especially directed in the fifth
and subsequent centuries the anathemas of Christian
councils, missionaries, and princes."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Taking
this evidence into consideration, is it far-fetched
to suggest that Sally Waters of the traditional
marriage game, which, in its most meaningful
form, is still played in the districts surrounding
Bath, may be related to Sul of the waters of Bath,
and to her followers, or ministrants, the Sulevæ?</p>

<p>We know nothing further of Sul as far as our
islands are concerned. But in Central France
a female impersonation of the sun is still called
upon as <i>La Soule</i>, and St. Solange, patron saint
of Berry, who is represented with a light over
her forehead, is looked upon as heir to her in the
pantheon of Christian saints. Sulis also was
a place-name in Brittany during Roman times,
situated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
 somewhere between Auray and Quimper.
It seems probable that the site is identical with
that of the present St. Anne d'Auray, famous for
its holy waters, which are still sought in pilgrimage
from far and near. The enormous stone basin
into which pilgrims are dipped, remains its most
curious feature.</p>

<p>In Scandinavian nursery lore we also come
across a <i>Fru Sole</i>, the mother of many daughters,
who sat in heaven, and across <i>Fru Soletopp</i>, who
distributed gifts. These names may be related
to Sul of the waters of Bath, or to Sally of our
game, or to both. However this may be, the wide
distribution of the game known as <i>Sally Waters</i>,
and its peculiar connection with the south-west
of England, induce the belief that there is some
relation between Sally of the game, and Sul, the
divinity of the waters.</p>

<p class="chap"><i>THE LADY OF THE LAND</i></p>


<p class="cap noin">ASSOCIATIONS dating from heathen times
are preserved in other traditional games,
the full meaning of which becomes apparent only
when we compare these with their foreign parallels.
Some of these games in their cruder and more
primitive forms are sports, in which dialogue takes
the place of rhymed verses, and in which the
characters that are introduced are frequently
spoken of as animals.</p>

<p>Among the dancing and singing games first
described by Halliwell is one called by him <i>The
Lady of the Land</i>. In this game one side is taken
by a mother and her daughters, the other by
a second woman, and the game consists in the
daughters changing sides. The verses that are
recited are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
<span class="i4">Here comes a woman from Babyland,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With three small children in her hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">One can brew, the other can bake,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The other can make a pretty round cake.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">One can sit in the garden and spin,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Another can make a fine bed for a king.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Pray m'am will you take one in?<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1846, p. 121.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One child is then pointed out and passes to
the other side, and this is continued till all are
selected.</p>

<p>Twelve further variations of the words used in
playing this game were recovered from different
parts of the country by Mrs. Gomme (1894, I,
313). Of these two, one from Shropshire (No. 3)
and one from the Isle of Wight (No. 6), like that
of Halliwell, designate the woman as "from
Babyland." Others, from the Isle of Man
and from Galloway (Appendix), describe her as
from Babylon, while further variations mention
Sandiland (No. 9), Cumberland (Berks, No. 8),
and others. The word Babyland, which occurs
in three out of thirteen variations of the game,
is probably the original one, for it has a parallel
in the corresponding German game in the
name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
 <i>Engelland</i>, the land of the spirits of the
unborn.</p>

<p>The Babyland game in a more primitive form
is known as <i>Little Dog I call you</i>, in which the
players also change sides (1894, I, 330). In
this game, the one side is taken by a girl who
looks after a number of children, the other by
a girl who is designated as <i>Little Dog</i>, and who
stands apart. The children secretly impart their
wishes to their owner or leader, who warns them
against laughing, and then calls the Little Dog
and tells him to pick out the child who has expressed
such and such a wish. Should this child
laugh by inadvertence, she at once goes over to
the Little Dog. If not, the dog is left to guess
who has imparted the wish, and by doing so he
secures the child. If he fails to guess aright, the
child goes and stands behind the leader and is
altogether removed out of the reach of the Little
Dog. This is continued till all belong to one side
or the other, and the game concludes with a tug
of war.</p>

<p>The games of <i>The Lady of the Land</i> and <i>Little
Dog</i> have parallels in the foreign game of
children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
 changing sides, fourteen variations of
which were collected from different parts of
northern Europe by Mannhardt (M., p. 273).
The closest parallel to <i>The Lady of the Land</i> is
played in Belgium, in which sides are taken by
two leaders, of whom the one has many daughters
and the other has none. The game is called
<i>Riche et pauvre</i> and the following verses are
sung:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Je suis pauvre, je suis pauvre, Anne Marie Jacqueline;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Je suis pauvre dans ce jeu d'ici.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Je suis riche, je suis riche, Anne Marie Jacqueline;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Je suis riche dans ce jeu d'ici.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Donnez-moi un de vos enfants, Anne Marie Jacqueline,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Donnez-moi un de vos enfants, dans ce jeu d'ici.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(M., No. 13.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small pb"><p>"I am poor, I am poor in this game, I am rich in this
game. Give me one of your children, in this game."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is continued as in the Babyland game
till every child has had its turn. There is no
sequel.</p>

<p>In the German game the woman who owns the
children is called sometimes Mary, sometimes
Witch, but usually she has the name of a heathen
divinity. Thus in Mecklenburg she is <i>Fru Goden</i>
or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
 <i>Fru Gol</i> (No. 11). Gode is the name of a
mother divinity, who, as <i>Godmor</i>, is the mother
of Thor (Gr., p. 209, note). In the game as played
in Prussia (No. 10), in Elsass (No. 3), in Swabia
(No. 2), and in Aargau (No. 4), she is <i>Frau Ros</i>
or <i>Frau Rose</i>, that is Lady Ros or Rose; while
in Pommerellen she is either <i>Ole Moder Rose</i> or
<i>Ole Moder Taersche</i> (No. 1), a word that signifies
witch. In Holstein, on the other hand, the
alternative is recorded as <i>Fru Rosen</i> or <i>Mutter
Marie</i>, Mother Mary (No. 9), while in Appenzell
(No. 5) and near Dunkirk (No. 6) the owner of
the children is <i>Marei Muetter Gotts</i>, i.e. Mary the
Mother of God. Mannhardt points out that
Ross, sometimes Rose, is the name of a German
mother divinity who occurs frequently in German
folk-lore. I have come across Mother Ross in our
own chapbook literature, where the name may be
traditional also. Mary indicates the substitution
of a Christian name in the place of the older
heathen one. In Sweden the owner of many
babes is <i>Fru Sole</i>, who is represented as sitting
in heaven surrounded by her daughters, who are
described as chickens (No. 14).</p>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
 game of securing children is called in
Switzerland <i>Das Englein aufziehen</i> (No. 5), that
is, "the drawing forth of an angel." The word
<i>Engel</i>, angel, according to the information
collected by Mannhardt, originally designates the
spirit that awaits re-birth. For the heathen inhabitants
of Northern Europe, including the
Kelts, were unable to realize individual death.
They held that the living spirit passed away
with death, but continued in existence, and again
reappeared under another shape. In the civilization
that belonged to the mother age, these
spirits or angels that awaited re-birth, peopled the
realm which was associated with divine mothers
or mother divinities. At a later period, transferred
into Christian belief, they were pictured as
a host of winged babes, whom we find represented
in mediaeval art hovering around the Virgin
Mother and Child.</p>

<p>The land in which the unborn spirits dwelt, is
generally spoken of in German nursery and folk
rhymes as <i>Engelland</i>, an expression which forms
a direct parallel to the expression Babyland of
our game. Thus the <i>Woman of Babyland</i>, like
<i>Frau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
 Rose</i> or <i>Frau Gode</i> of the German game,
was in all probability a divine mother, who was
the owner of the spirits or babes that awaited re-birth.</p>

<p>In the estimation of Mannhardt, the game in
which children are drawn from one woman into
the possession of the other, preserves the relics
of a ceremonial connected with the cult of the
mother divinity. It visibly set forth how the
spirits of the departed were drawn back into life
(M., p. 319). Perhaps we may go a step further.
The study of folk-lore has taught us that to
simulate a desired result is one way of working
for its attainment. Women who were desirous
of becoming mothers, both in England and in
Germany, were wont to rock an empty cradle.
They also visited particular shrines. Of the rites
which they practised there we know nothing.
Perhaps the Babyland game originated not as
an ideal conception, but preserves the relics of a
rite by which women sought to promote motherhood.
This assumption is supported by various
features that are incidental to the game.</p>

<p>Thus the game, both in England and abroad,
is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
 essentially a girls' game, and the words that
are used indicate that it is played by them only.
Even where the generality of the players are
designated as "children," the leaders are invariably
girls.</p>

<p>Again, in some versions of the foreign game
(Nos. 8, 9) there is mention of salt. The woman
who asks for a child, complains that she has lost
those that were given to her; she is told that she
ought to have sprinkled them with salt (No. 8).
Sprinkling with salt is still observed at Christian
baptism in some districts, and such sprinkling is
said to make a child safe.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Again, in the game as played abroad the child
that is chosen is put to the test if it can be made
to laugh (Nos. 2, 4, 5, 8). In the game of <i>Little
Dog</i> also, the child that laughs passes into the
keeping of a new owner. Laughing indicates
quickening into life, and in folk-lore generally
the child that refrains from laughing is reckoned
uncanny. Numerous stories are told of the
changeling that was made to laugh and disappeared,
when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
 the real child was found restored
to its cradle.</p>

<p>Again, in the foreign game the player who
seeks to secure a child speaks of herself as
lame, and limps in order to prove herself so
(Nos. 1, 2, 14). In one instance she attributes
her limping to a bone in her leg. Limping, in
the estimation of Mannhardt, is peculiar to the
woman who has borne children (M., p. 305).
For in German popular parlance the woman who
is confined, is said to have been bitten by the
stork who brought the child.</p>

<p>A reminiscence of this idea lurks in our proverb
rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">The wife who expects to have a good name,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Is always at home as if she were lame;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And the maid that is honest, her chiefest delight<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Is still to be doing from morning till night.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Again, in one version of the foreign game the
children that are won over are given the names
of dogs, and when their former owner attempts to
get them back, they rush at her and bark (No. 1).
This corresponds to our game of <i>Little Dog</i>, in
which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
 the child that stands apart is addressed as
"Little Dog I call you." Grimm declared himself
at a loss to account for the fact that a dog
was associated with the Norns or Fate-maidens
who assisted at childbirth (Gr., p. 339); Mannhardt
cites the belief that the spirits of the dead
were sometimes spoken of as dogs (M., p. 301);
and in England there also exists a superstition
that the winds that rush past at night are dogs,
the so-called Gabriel hounds or ratchets (cf.
below, p. 165).</p>

<p>Features preserved in other games contain
similar suggestions which are worth noting.</p>

<p>Thus in the game known as <i>Drop-handkerchief</i>
one girl holding a kerchief goes round the others
who are arranged in a circle, saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">I have a little dog and it won't bite you<br /></span>
<span class="i4">It won't bite you, it won't bite you [<i>ad lib.</i>]<br /></span>
<span class="i4">It <i>will</i> bite you.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1894, I, 109.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>The person on whom <i>the little dog</i> is bestowed is
"bitten"; that is, she is in the same predicament
as the German woman who is bitten by the stork,
and the limping woman of the German Babyland
game.</p>

<p>In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
 playing <i>Drop-handkerchief</i> in Deptford the
children sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">I had a little dog whose name was Buff,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I sent him up the street for a pennyworth of snuff.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He broke my box and spilt my snuff<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I think my story is long enough&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">'Taint you, 'taint you, and 'taint you, but 'tis you.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1894, I, p. 111.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the collection of Nursery Songs by Rusher
stands the following rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">I had a little dog and they called him Buff,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I sent him to a shop to buy me snuff,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But he lost the bag and spilt the stuff;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I sent him no more but gave him a cuff,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For coming from the mart without any snuff.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Bufe" as a word for a dog occurs as far back
as 1567.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p class="chap">CUSTOM RHYMES</p>


<p class="cap noin">THE comparison of our short nursery rhymes
with those current in other countries, next
engages our attention. Halliwell has remarked
that some of our rhymes are chanted by the
children of Germany and Scandinavia, which
to him strikingly exhibited the great antiquity
and remote origin of these rhymes. The observation
which he made with regard to the countries
of Northern Europe, applies to the countries of
Central and Southern Europe also. Scholarly
collections of rhymes have been published during
recent years in Scandinavia, Germany, France, Italy,
Spain, and referring to special parts of these countries,
which give us a fair insight into their nursery
lore. (Cf., p. 212). The comparison of these collections
with ours yields surprising results. Often the
same thought is expressed in the same form of
verse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
 Frequently the same proper name reappears
in the same connection. In many cases rhymes,
that seem senseless taken by themselves, acquire
a definite meaning when taken in conjunction
with their foreign parallels. Judging from what
we know of nursery rhymes and their appearance
in print, the thought of a direct translation of
rhymes in the bulk cannot be entertained. We
are therefore left to infer, either that rhymes were
carried from one country to another at a time
when they were still meaningful, or else that they
originated in different countries as the outcome of
the same stratum of thought.</p>

<p>The sorting of nursery rhymes according to
the number of their foreign parallels, yields an
additional criterion as to the relative antiquity of
certain rhymes. For those rhymes that embody
the more primitive conceptions are those that are
spread over the wider geographical area. The
above inquiry has shown that pieces such as
<i>Mother Hubbard</i> and <i>Three Blind Mice</i> are relatively
new, and that all the rhymes formed on
the model of <i>Little Miss Muffet</i> go back to the
<i>Cushion Dance</i> and to the game of <i>Sally Waters</i>.
Rhymes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
 of this kind are entirely without foreign
parallels. On the other hand, calls, such as those
addressed to the ladybird and the snail, and
riddle-rhymes, such as that on <i>Humpty Dumpty</i>,
have numerous and close parallels half across
Europe.</p>

<p>The ladybird is the representative among ourselves
of a large class of insects which were associated
with the movement of the sun from the
earliest times. The association goes back to the
<i>kheper</i> or chafer of ancient Egypt, which has the
habit of rolling along the ball that contains its
eggs. This ball was identified as the orb of the
sun, and the <i>kheper</i> was esteemed as the beneficent
power that helped to keep it moving.</p>

<p>A like importance attached to the chafers that
had the power of flying, especially to the ladybird
(<i>Coccinella septem punctata</i>). In India the insect
was called <i>Indragopas</i>, that is "protected by
Indra." The story is told how this insect flew
too near the sun, singed its wings, and fell back
to the earth.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>In Greece the same idea was embodied in the
myth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
 of Ikaros, the son of Dædalus, who flew too
near the sun with the wings he had made for himself,
and, falling into the sea, was drowned.
Already the ancient Greeks were puzzled by this
myth, which found its reasonable explanation
in describing Ikaros as the inventor of sails.
He was the first to attach sails to a boat, and
sailing westwards, he was borne out to sea and
perished.</p>

<p>Among ourselves the ladybird is always
addressed in connection with its power of flight.
It is mostly told to return to its house or home,
which is in danger of being destroyed by fire, and
warned of the ruin threatening its children if
it fails to fly. But some rhymes address it on
matters of divination, and one urges it to bring
down blessings from heaven.</p>

<p>The rhyme addressed to the ladybird first
appears in the nursery collection of 1744, where
it stands as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0" style="margin-left: .5em;">1.  Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Your house is on fire, your children will burn.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Many variations of the rhyme are current in
different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
 parts of the country, which may be
tabulated as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>The comparison of these rhymes with their
foreign parallels, of which a number were collected
by Mannhardt, shows that a rhyme current in
Saxony is very close to ours:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Himmelsküchlein, flieg aus!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Dein Haus brennt,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Deine kinder weinen alle miteinander.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(M., p. 349.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small pb"><p>"Heaven's little chicken, fly away; thy house is on
fire, thy children are all crying."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mannhardt was of opinion that the ladybird
rhyme originated as a charm intended to speed
the sun across the dangers of sunset, that is,
the "house on fire" or welkin of the West,
which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
 is set aglow at sundown. Throughout
the East a prayer is still uttered to the setting
sun in order to ensure its safe return on the
morrow.</p>

<p>The ladybird is known by a variety of names
both in England and abroad. Among ourselves
it is identified as a cow, a bird, or a bee, while
the <i>lady</i> of our rhymes reappears as Mary in the
German expression <i>Marienkäfer</i>. In Sweden the
ladybird is addressed as <i>Jungfru Marias Nyckelpiga</i>,
"the Lady Mary's keybearer," and this
expression is explained by the story that the
Virgin lost the keys of heaven, and that all the
animals helped her to look for them. They
were found by the ladybird, to whose care they
are now entrusted. The keys of heaven have
been interpreted as the lightning which opened
the floodgates of heaven. For the mother divinities
were credited with making the weather,
with giving rain, and with washing. This latter
association lingers in the Scottish ladybird rhyme,
in which the ladybird is addressed as landers, i.e.
laundress (M., p. 250, foot-note).</p>

<p>In Potsdam they sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
<span class="i6">Marienwörmken flïg furt,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Flïg furt nach Engelland!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Engelland ist zugeschlossen,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Schlüssel davon abgebrochen.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(M., p. 347.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small pb"><p>"Insect of Mary, fly away, fly away to Engelland.
Engelland is locked, its key is broken."</p></blockquote>

<p>The rhyme thus combines the idea of the keys
of heaven with <i>Engelland</i>, the home of the
unborn spirits, and with Mary, to whom the insect
is dedicated.</p>

<p>Many of our ladybird rhymes refer to the
danger that is threatening, probably from sunset
or the direction of the West, but one person is
safe. It is little Nan, who sits weaving gold
laces. Spinning gold or silk was a prerogative of
the mother divinities who sat in heaven (Gr., 223,
M., 705). Another rhyme calls her Ann. Nan
or Ann reappears in the corresponding ladybird
rhymes of Switzerland and Swabia. In Aargau
they sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Goldchäber, flüg uf, uf dine hoche Tanne,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Zue diner Muetter Anne.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Si git dir Chäs und Brod,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">'s isch besser as der bitter Tod.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(R., p. 464.)</span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small pb"><p>"Gold-chafer,<span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
 up and away, up to thy high story, to thy
Mother Anne, who gives thee bread and cheese. 'Tis better
than bitter death."</p></blockquote>

<p>In Swabia they sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Sonnevögele flieg aus,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Flieg in meiner Ahne Haus,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Bring mir Aepfel und Bire;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Komm bald wieder.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(Me., p. 24.)</span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small pb"><p>"Sunbird, fly away, fly to my ancestress' house; bring
me apples and pears; come back soon."</p></blockquote>

<p>This request to the ladybird to bring down
gifts from heaven has a parallel in our rhyme
which entreats it to "carry up ten pounds, and
bring down eleven."</p>

<p>According to another of our rhymes the one
who is safe at home is Tom, who lies under the
grindelstone, that is the grindstone. The analysis
of the stories that are told of Tom shows
that he is related to the northern god Thor, and
that the grindstone corresponds to Thor's hammer.
Moreover, in Scandinavian folk-lore there is a
house-sprite called Tommelgubbe, literally Tom-boy,
who took offence if work was done on a
Thursday, the day sanctified to the god Thor.
The hammer of Thor was called <i>Mjölnir</i>, that is
pounder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
 and with it the god was busy in summertime
in heaven, pounding ice into snow.</p>

<p>In an old story-book called <i>Tom Hickathrift</i>,
otherwise <i>Hickifric</i>,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> traits are preserved in connection
with Tom, which recall the peculiarities
of the god Thor. Tom dwelt with his mother,
who slept on straw; there was no father. Thor
had no father; his mother was designated as
Godmor. Tom ate hugely, Thor did the same.
Tom flung his hammer into the river, Thor
measured distance by throwing his hammer.
Tom carted beer&mdash;a trait that recalls Thor's fits
of drunkenness. On one occasion Tom made
himself a weapon by sticking an axle-tree into a
waggon-wheel, which suggests that Thor's hammer
was a flat stone mace. Likewise Tom, having
broken his club, "seized upon a lusty raw-boned
miller," and used him as a weapon. Can
we hesitate from accepting that this "miller" in
a confused manner recalls the <i>Mjölnir</i>&mdash;that is
the hammer&mdash;of the northern god Thor?</p>

<p>The analysis of the ladybird rhymes takes us
even farther afield. In Saxony they sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
<span class="i4">Flieg, Käfer, flieg, dein Vater ist im Krieg,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Deine Mutter ist in den Stiefel gekroche,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Hat das linke Bein gebroche.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(M., p. 347.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small pb"><p>"Fly, chafer, fly, father has gone to war, mother has
crept into the shoe, she has broken her left leg."</p></blockquote>

<p>The mother with the broken leg of this rhyme
recalls the limping mother of the Babyland game,
and the person in <i>Drop Handkerchief</i>, who was
bitten. The expression of "creeping into a shoe"
yields a clue to the nature of the woman of one
of our rhymes who lived in a shoe, and was oppressed
by the number of her children. In one
form this rhyme, cited above in connection with
the tale of Mother Hubbard, describes how the
children were to all appearance dead, but were
quickened into life. This conception is allied to
the quickening into life of the babes in the
Babyland game. In its earliest printed form the
rhyme stands as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">There was an old woman who lived in a shoe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She had so many children she didn't know what to do;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She gave them some broth without any bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She whipped all their bums and sent them to bed.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(<i>c.</i> 1783, p. 52.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
 of our ladybird rhymes which call on
the insect in matters of love divination have
their closest parallels in Scandinavia. In Sweden
they sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Jungfru Marias Nyckelpiga,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Flyg öster, flyg vester,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Flyg dit der bor din älskede.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1849, p. 5.)</span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small pb"><p>"Fly, Our Lady's keybearer! fly east, fly west, fly
where thy lover dwells."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of the rhymes of this class, one introduces the
term Golloway. This may be intended for Yellow
Way, the course of the sun in daytime, as distinct
from the Milky Way, the course of the stars at
night.</p>

<p>Another rhyme begins with the call Bishop,
bishop, which has puzzled various commentators.
I venture to suggest that the word be read Beeship,
and that it indicates the boat that sailed
across heaven bearing the souls of the dead, who
were figured as bees. For the spirits of those
who passed away, viewed under one aspect, were
bees, and the ship that conveyed the dead in
Norsk saga was actually designated as the
<i>Býskip</i>. Mannhardt, in illustration, cites a
line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
 which the skald Egil Skallagrimssonr, whose
date is between 902 and 980, sang on his son
that had been drowned:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Byrr es býskips i boe kominn kvanar son.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small pb"><p>"In the beeship there has gone the son of my wife."</p></blockquote>

<p>Our commentators inaccurately translate the
expression as "City of the Hive" (C. P., I,
546).</p>

<p>According to a fancy of the Welsh bards,
Britain was peopled with bees before the arrival
of man, and this was held to account for its name,
the "Isle of Honey."</p>

<p>A Prussian ladybird rhyme also mentions the
boat that sailed across heaven. In Dantzig they
sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Herrgotspferdchen, fliege weg,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Dein Häuschen brennt, dein Kähnchen schwimmt,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Deine Kinder schreien nach Butterbrod;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Herrgotspferdchen, fliege weg.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(M., 349.)</span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small pb"><p>"God Almighty's little horse, fly away, thy house is on
fire, thy boat is afloat, thy children cry for bread and
butter."</p></blockquote>

<p>From an early period the sun was supposed to
be conveyed in a boat, and boats were associated
with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
 divinities half the world over. Tacitus was
acquainted with the boat of the goddess Isis
that was conveyed about in Alexandria, and he
described the boat that was taken about in procession
by the heathen Germans in their cult of
Hertha, as the boat of Isis (Gr., p. 214). The
sun-boat of Ra in Egypt conveyed the dead to
heaven. So did the golden ship of Odin in
Scandinavia, which conveyed the bodies of the
fallen warriors to Valhalla. The remembrance
of this sun-boat probably gave rise to the story
how Ikaros invented sails. It may linger still in
the "beeship" of our rhymes, and in the
"Kähnchen" of the corresponding German ladybird
rhyme.</p>

<p class="chap">RIDDLE-RHYMES</p>


<p class="cap noin">AMONG other rhymes which date some way
back in history are those which may fitly
be called riddle-rhymes. Some of these have close
parallels in the nursery lore of other countries.
The most interesting example of this class is the
rhyme on Humpty-Dumpty which deals with the
egg. The egg from the earliest times formed an
enigma in itself, and was looked upon as representing
the origin of life. Aristophanes knew of the
great bird that laid the world-egg. According
to <i>Kalevala</i>, the Finnish epic, the world-egg fell
and broke. Its upper part became the vault of
heaven, its lower part the earth. The yolk
formed the sun, the white the moon, and the
fragments of the shell became the stars in heaven.
Reminiscences of this idea of a world-egg linger
in the <i>Senchus Mor</i> of Ireland and in the <i>Volospa</i>
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
 Norse saga. In Tibet the holy Budh is
represented holding in his hand a broken egg-shell,
on the edge of which a diminutive human being
is sometimes represented sitting. These world-wide
conceptions account for the existence of
numerous riddles that are current about the egg.</p>

<p>The rhyme on Humpty-Dumpty among us is
current in three variations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Humpty-Dumpty sate on a wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Humpty-Dumpty had a great fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Threescore men and threescore more<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Cannot place Humpty-Dumpty as he was before.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1810, p. 36.)<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">Cannot set Humpty-Dumpty up again.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(1842, p. 113.)<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Humpty-Dumpty lay in a beck<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With all his sinews around his neck;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Forty doctors and forty wights<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Couldn't put Humpty-Dumpty to rights.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(1846, p. 209.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Many parallels of this rhyme were collected
from different parts of Europe by Mannhardt.
In these Humpty-Dumpty appears under various
names. They include Hümpelken-Pümpelken,
Rüntzelken-Püntzelken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
 Wirgele-Wargele, Gigele-Gagele,
and Etje-Papetje in different parts of
Germany, and Lille-Trille and Lille Bulle in
Scandinavia. The closest parallel of our rhyme
hails from Saxony, and stands as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Hümpelken-Pümpelken sat up de Bank,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hümpelken-Pümpelken fël von de Bank;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Do is kën Docter in Engelland<br /></span>
<span class="i2">De Hümpelken-Pümpelken kurere kann.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"H.-P. sat on a bench, H.-P. fell from the bench;
there is no doctor in Engelland who can restore H.-P."</p></blockquote>

<p>In Switzerland the rhyme of Humpty-Dumpty
is told of Annebadadeli. The usual answer is
an egg, but sometimes it is an icicle or a feeding-bottle.</p>

<p>In Scandinavia they say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Lille Bulle trilla' ner a skulle;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Ingen man i detta lan'<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Lille Bulle laga kan.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1849, p. 9.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"Little B. fell from the shelf, no man in the whole
land can restore little B."</p></blockquote>

<p>This has a further parallel in France in a rhyme
which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
 reproduces the German expression Engelland
regardless of its intrinsic meaning:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Boule, boule su l'keyere,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Boule, boule par terre.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Y n'a nuz homme en Angleterre<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Pou l'erfaire.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"B. b. on the bench, B. b. on the ground. There is
no man in England who can restore him."</p></blockquote>

<p>The forty doctors of our rhyme who figure also
as twice threescore men, reappear in the German
rhyme as "no doctor in <i>Engelland</i>," as "no man
in all the land" in the Scandinavian rhyme, and
as "no man in England" literally translated, of
the French version.</p>

<p>In one version of our rhyme those who are
powerless to restore what is broken are described
as "all the king's soldiers and all the king's men."
This expression is also used in the riddle-rhymes
on Smoke and on the Well, which are found in
our own and in foreign nursery collections.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">As round as an apple, as deep as a cup,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And all the king's horses cannot pull it up.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(Smoke, 1849, p. 144.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Swabia they say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Es ist etwas in meinem Haus,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Es ziehen es hundert tausend Gäule nicht naus.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(Me., p. 79.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"There is something in my house, not a hundred
thousand horses can pull it out."</p></blockquote>

<p>The answer is "Smoke." In France they
say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Qu'est-ce-qui est rond comme un dé,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Et que des chevaux ne peuvent porter.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"What is as round as a thimble, and horses cannot
pull it?"</p></blockquote>

<p>The answer is "A well." Possibly the "king"
of these rhymes stands for the sun as the representative
of power, whose horses and men are
alike powerless.</p>

<p>The egg, which in these rhymes is designated
by fanciful names, in other riddle-rhymes current
abroad is described as a cask containing two kinds
of beer. A riddle was put by the god Wodan
in the character of a wayfarer to King Heidrek,
and stood as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Blond&mdash;haired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
 brides, bondswomen both,
carried ale to the barn; the casks were not turned
with hands nor forged by hammers; she that
made it strutted about outside the isle." The
answer is "Eider-ducks' eggs" (C. P., I, 89).</p>

<p>The egg is also likened to a cask containing beer
in a short riddle-rhyme which is current from
Lapland to Hungary. In the Faroe Islands it
takes this form: "Bolli fell from the ledge, all its
hoops fell off. There is no man in the East,
there is no man in the West, who can restore it"
(M., p. 417). In Prussia they say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Kommt ein Tonn aus Engelland,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Ohne Boden, ohne Band;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Ist zweierleai Bier drin.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(Sim., p. 287.)</span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"A cask comes from Engelland, without bottom, without
band; it contains two kinds of beer."</p></blockquote>

<p>Among ourselves there is no riddle-rhyme,
as far as I know, which describes the egg as a cask
containing beer. But in the seventeenth century
the word Humpty-Dumpty was used to designate
a drink which consisted of ale boiled in brandy,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
and this conception obviously hangs together with
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
 two kinds of beer of the foreign riddle-rhymes
on the egg.</p>

<p>Other riddle-rhymes current among ourselves
or abroad describe the egg as a house or a castle.
The following one describes it as an enigma
in itself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">As I was going o'er London Bridge<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I saw something under a hedge;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">'Twas neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor bone,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And yet in three weeks it runned alone.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(1846, p. 213.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Girls in America play a game called <i>Humpty-Dumpty</i>.
They sit on the ground with their
skirts tightly gathered around them so as to
enclose the feet. The leader begins some rhyme,
all join in, and at a certain word previously agreed
upon, all throw themselves backwards, keeping
their skirts tightly grasped. The object is to
recover the former position without letting go
the skirt (N., p. 132).</p>

<p>Possibly the game is older than the riddle-rhymes,
for these rhymes describe <i>Humpty-Dumpty</i>
as sitting on a wall, or a bank, or a
ledge, or as lying in a beck, which for an actual
egg are impossible situations. They are intelligible
on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
 the assumption that the sport is older
than the rhyme, and that the rhyme describes
human beings who are personating eggs.</p>

<p>The name Humpty-Dumpty itself is one of the
large class of rhyming compounds which are
formed by the varied reduplication of the same
word. Perhaps they originally conveyed a definite
meaning. The word Humpty-Dumpty is allied
to <i>hump</i> and to <i>dump</i>, words which express roundness
and shortness. Another name of the kind is
Hoddy-Doddy, which occurs in the following
riddle-rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Hoddy-Doddy with a round, black body;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Three legs and a wooden hat, what is that?<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1849, p. 142.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The answer is "An iron pot."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The word
Hoddy-Doddy in the sixteenth century was
directly used to express "a short and dumpy
person" (1553). It was also applied to a "hen-pecked
man" (1598).<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The meaning of shortness
and roundness is expressed also by the name of
the foreign equivalents of Humpty-Dumpty. The
German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
 Hümpelken-Pümpelken, and probably
Lille Bulle of Scandinavia convey the same idea.
On the other hand, the names Wirgele-Wargele
and Gigele-Gagele suggest instability. The
Danish Lille Trille is allied to <i>lille trölle</i>, little
troll, that is, a member of the earlier and stumpy
race of men who, by a later age, were accounted
dwarves. These were credited in folk-lore with
sex-relations of a primitive kind, an allusion to
which seems to linger in the word Hoddy-Doddy
as applied to a hen-pecked man.</p>

<p>Among other rhyming compounds is the word
<i>Hitty-Pitty</i>. It occurs in a riddle-rhyme which
Halliwell traced back to the seventeenth century
(MS. Harl. 1962):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Hitty Pitty within the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Hitty Pitty without the wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">If you touch Hitty Pitty,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Hitty Pitty will bite you.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(A nettle, 1849, p. 149.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This verse is sometimes used in playing <i>Hide
and Seek</i> as a warning to the player who approaches
the place that is "hot" (1894, I, 211).
A variation of the word is <i>Highty-Tighty</i>, which
is preserved in the following rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Highty, tighty, paradighty, clothed in green,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The king could not read it, no more could the queen;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They sent for a wise man out of the East,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who said it had horns, but was not a beast.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1842, p. 118.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The answer is "A holly tree."</p>

<p>Another rhyming compound is preserved in the
riddle-rhyme on the sunbeam:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Hick-a-more, Hack-a-more<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Hung on a kitchen door;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Nothing so long, and nothing so strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As Hick-a-more, Hack-a-more<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Hung on the kitchen door.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1846, p. 207.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The following riddle-rhyme preserves the word
lilly-low, which is the north-country term for the
flame of a candle:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Lilly-low, lilly-low, set up on end,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">See little baby go out at town end.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(A candle, 1849, p. 146.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another riddle on the candle, which also stands
in MS. Harl. 1962, and has found its way into
nursery collections, is:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Little Nancy Etticoat with a white petticoat,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And a red nose;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The longer she stands, the shorter she grows.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(1842, p. 114.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
 recalls a riddle current in Devonshire,
where the sky is called widdicote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Widdicote, widdicote, over cote hang;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Nothing so broad, and nothing so lang<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As Widdicote, etc.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1892, p. 333.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All these riddle-rhymes are based on primitive
conceptions, and all have parallels in the nursery
lore of other countries. The rhyme on Hoddy-Doddy
in Norwegian is simply descriptive; in
France it is told in the form of words exchanged
between <i>Noiret</i>, "Blacky," the pot, and <i>Rouget</i>,
"Ruddy," the fire. In Italy the Pot, the Smoke,
and the Fire are described as three sisters.
Again, the riddle-rhyme on the candle is told in
Swabia and in France. But in no case are the
foreign parallels as close as in the riddle-rhyme of
Humpty-Dumpty, and in no case do they preserve
the same interesting allusions.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="chap">CUMULATIVE PIECES</p>


<p class="cap noin">WE now turn to rhymes which dwell on
different ideas and present life under
other aspects. In these rhymes there is much on
spells, on the magic properties of numbers, and
on sacrificial hunting. A fatalistic tendency
underlies many of these rhymes, and there are
conscious efforts to avert danger.</p>

<p>The different range of ideas which are here
expressed is reflected in the form of verse in
which they are presented. While the rhymes
hitherto discussed are set in verse which depends
for its consistency on tail rhyme and
assonance, the pieces that deal with the magic
properties of things and with hunting, are mostly
set in a form of verse that depends for its consistency
on repetition and cumulation. This
difference in form is probably due to the different
origin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
 of these pieces. Rhymed verse may have
originated in dancing and singing&mdash;cumulative
verse in recitation and instruction.</p>

<p>In cumulative recitation one sentence is uttered
and repeated, a second sentence is uttered and
repeated, then the first sentence is said; a third
sentence is uttered and repeated, followed by the
second and the first. Thus each sentence adds
to the piece and carries it back to the beginning.
Supposing each letter to stand for a
sentence, the form of recitation can thus be
described: A, a; B, b, a; C, c, b, a; D, d, c, b,
a; etc. This manner of recitation is well known
among ourselves, but I know of no word to
designate it. In Brittany the form of recitation
is known as <i>chant de grénouille</i>, i.e. frog-chant.
A game of forfeits was known in the eighteenth
century, which was called <i>The Gaping Wide-mouthed
Waddling Frog</i>, in which the verses were
recited in exactly the same manner. We shall
return to it later. A relation doubtless exists
between this game and the French expression
frog-chant.</p>

<p>Among our most familiar pieces that are set in
cumulative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
 form are <i>The Story of the Old Woman
and Her Pig</i> and <i>This is the House that Jack
built</i>. They both consist of narrative, and are
told as stories. <i>This is the House that Jack
built</i> first appeared in print as a toy-book that
was issued by Marshall at his printing office,
Aldermary Churchyard. It is illustrated with cuts,
and its date is about 1770. Perhaps the story is
referred to in the <i>Boston News Letter</i> (No. 183)
of 12-19 April, 1739, in which the reviewer of Tate
and Brady's Version of the Psalms remarks that this
"makes our children think of the tune of their
vulgar playsong so like it: this is the man all
forlorn." The sentence looks like a variation of
the line "this is the maiden all forlorn" in <i>This
is the House that Jack built</i>.</p>

<p>In 1819 there was published in London a satire
by Hone, called <i>The Political House that Jack
built</i>. It was illustrated by Cruikshank, and
went through fifty-four editions. In form it
imitates the playsong, which was doubtless as
familiar then as it is now.</p>

<p>The playsong in the form published by
Marshall begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
<span class="i0">This is the house that Jack built,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the malt that lay in the house that Jack built,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the rat that ate the malt that lay in the house that Jack built,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">which is followed by the cat that killed the rat&mdash;the
dog that worried the cat&mdash;the cow that tossed
the dog&mdash;the maiden that milked the cow&mdash;the
man that kissed the maid&mdash;the priest that married
them. Here it ended. But a further line added
by Halliwell (1842, p. 222) mentioned the cock
that crowed on the morn of the wedding-day, and
a lady of over seventy has supplied me with one
more line, on the knife that killed the cock. She
tells me that she had the story from her nurse,
and that she does not remember seeing it in
print. The version she repeated in cumulative
form, told to me, ended as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">This is the knife with a handle of horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">that killed the cock that crowed in the morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">that wakened the priest all shaven and shorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">that married the man all tattered and torn,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">that milked the cow with a crumpled horn,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">that Jack built.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
 greater part of this piece consists of
rhymed verse, and deals with matters of courtship.
The idea of a cock sacrificed on the
wedding-day is certainly heathen in origin, but
its introduction forms a new departure when we
come to compare this piece with its foreign
parallels and with the story of <i>The Old Woman
and Her Pig</i>. These pieces are all set in the
same form, and all introduce a regular sequence
of relative powers.</p>

<p><i>The Old Woman and Her Pig</i> was first printed
by Halliwell (1842, p. 219). It tells how the woman
found sixpence, and how she set out for market,
and bought a pig which on the way back refused
to jump over the stile. In order to break the spell
that had fallen on it, she summoned to her aid:
dog&mdash;stick&mdash;fire&mdash;water&mdash;ox&mdash;butcher&mdash;rope&mdash;rat&mdash;cat&mdash;cow.
The cow finally gave the milk
required by the cat, which set the other powers
going, and thus enabled the woman to get home
that night. Halliwell was impressed by the antiquity
of this sequence, and included in his
collection a translation of a Hebrew chant which
has considerable likeness to the tale of <i>The Old
Woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
 and Her Pig</i>. This chant is told in the
first person. It begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">A kid, a kid my father bought<br /></span>
<span class="i6">For two pieces of money,<br /></span>
<span class="i18">A kid, a kid.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Then came the cat and ate the kid,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">That my father bought,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">For two pieces of money.<br /></span>
<span class="i18">A kid, a kid.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(1842, p. 6.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It further introduces dog&mdash;staff&mdash;fire&mdash;water&mdash;ox&mdash;butcher&mdash;angel
of death&mdash;Holy One.</p>

<p>The Hebrew chant of the kid was printed in
Venice as far back as 1609, and was made the
subject of the learned Latin dissertation <i>De
Haedo</i> by Probst von der Hardt in 1727
(R., p. 153). It was again discussed by P. N.
Leberecht in 1731.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The chant forms part of the
Jewish liturgy, and is still recited in the original
Hebrew or in the vernacular as part of a religious
ceremonial at Easter. Opinions on the origin
and the meaning of the chant differ. One learned
rabbi interpreted it as setting forth how each
power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
 in creation is kept within bounds by a
power that stands above it. It teaches how he who
goes wrong is at the mercy of one stronger than
himself. But according to another interpretation
the Father who bought the kid was Jehovah himself,
the kid was the Hebrew, the cat represented
the Assyrians, the dog the Babylonians, and so
forth; and the whole poem described the position
of the Jews at the time of the Crusades.</p>

<p>The Hebrew chant and its relation to <i>The Old
Woman and her Pig</i> engaged the attention of
Professor Tylor, who remarked on the solemn
ending of the Hebrew chant, which according to
him may incline us to think that we really have
before us this composition in something like its
first form. "If so," he says, "then it follows
that our familiar tale of the Old Woman who
couldn't get the kid (<i>or</i> pig) over the stile, must
be considered as a broken-down adaptation of
this old Jewish poem."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>But the tale of the Old Woman taken in
conjunction with <i>This is the House that Jack
built</i> and its numerous foreign parallels, shows
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
 these sequences of relative powers, far from
being broken-down adaptations, are at least as
meaningful as the Hebrew chant. For the underlying
conception in all cases is that a spell has
fallen on an object which man is appropriating to
his use. The spell extends to everything, be it
man or beast, that comes within the range of
its influence, and the unmaking of the spell
necessitates going back step by step to the point
at which it originated.</p>

<p>Halliwell compared a piece current in Denmark
with <i>This is the House that Jack built</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Der har du det haus som Jacob bygde.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"Here hast thou the house that Jacob built."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Many other versions of this tale are current
in Germany and Scandinavia. In them it is sometimes
a question of a house, sometimes of corn,
oftenest of cutting oats or of garnering pears.
The cumulative form is throughout adhered to.
One German piece called <i>Ist alles verlorn</i>, "all is
lost," begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
<span class="i4">Es kam eine Maus gegangen<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In unser Korneha&#365;s,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Die nahm das Korn gefangen,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In &#365;nserm Korneha&#365;s.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Die Maus das Korn,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Ist alles verlorn<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In &#365;nserm Korneha&#365;s.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(Sim., p. 256.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"There came a mouse into our corn-house, she seized
the corn in our corn-house. The mouse, the corn, now
all is lost in our corn-house."</p></blockquote>

<p>The other powers are rat, cat, fox, wolf, bear,
man, maid. This piece, like <i>This is the House
that Jack built</i>, ends abruptly.</p>

<p>Among the less primitive variations of the tale
is one recorded in Sonneberg (S., p. 102), and
another in the north of France, which both substitute
the name of Peter for that of Jack, that is
a Christian name for a heathen one. In France
the piece is called <i>La Mouche</i>, literally "the fly,"
but its contents indicate that not <i>mouche</i> but the
Latin <i>mus</i> (mouse) was originally meant. The
tale departs from the usual form, and has a
refrain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Voici la maison que Pierre a bâtie,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Il sortait un rat de sa raterie,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Qui fit rentrer la mouch' dans sa moucherie:<br /></span><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
<span class="i4">Rat à mouche,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Belle, belle mouche<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Jamais je n'ai vu si belle mouche.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(D.B., p. 116.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"This is the house that Peter built. A rat came out of
a rat-hole, and made the fly go into the fly-hole. Rat
to fly, lovely fly, never saw I so lovely a fly."</p></blockquote>

<p>The other powers are dog, bear, man, maid,
abbot, pope, devil.</p>

<p>The same tale is told in Austria (V., p. 113), and
in Prussia (F., p. 197), where it is called <i>Das
Haus vom hölzernen Mann</i>, "the house of the
wooden Man." In Prussia it is recited as a
game of forfeits. The sequence of the powers
in the one version is house, door, lock, band,
mouse, cat, dog, stick, fire, water, ox, butcher,
devil; and in the other, house, door, lock, band,
mouse, cat, huntsman.</p>

<p>Jack in Germany is called Jockel, Jöggeli,
Jokele. <i>The Master who sent out Jockel</i> is mentioned
already in the Gargantua of Fischart,
which was published in 1575 (Chap. <span class="smcap">XXV</span>.). The
name Jack among ourselves is applied to a person
or an object of peculiar serviceableness, as in
Jack-of-all-trades, or boot-jack. But in Germany
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
 expression "to send Jockel on an errand"
implies that this will never get done.</p>

<p>In Vogtland the current nursery version of this
piece begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Es schickt der Herr den G&#527;kel 'naus,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Er soll den Haber schneiden.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(Du., p. 35.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"The master sent out Gokel to cut oats."</p></blockquote>

<p>As he failed to come back, dog, fire, water, ox,
butcher, hangman, devil, were sent after him.</p>

<p>In Swabia Jokele (Br., p. 44), and in Switzerland
Joggeli, was sent to knock off pears on which
a spell had fallen. The chant in Zürich has been
traced back to the year 1769, and it begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Es ist ein Baum im Gärtle hinne,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">d' Birren wänd nüd fallen.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Do schückt de Bur de Joggeli usen<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Er soll di Birren schütteln.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(R., p. 155.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"There is a tree in the garden, its pears will not drop.
The peasant sent out Joggeli to knock them off."</p></blockquote>

<p>But the pears refused to be knocked off, and
the usual sequence of powers was sent to secure
them.</p>

<p>The tale of Jack was current in Münster in
Westphalia also, where it was taken over by the
Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
 and annually recited at the religious
procession which took place on the eve of the
feast of St. Lambert, 17 September. This was
done as late as the year 1810 (R., p. 155). The
recitation was followed or accompanied by a dance,
the purpose of which is not recorded. Perhaps
the procession stood in relation to the actual
garnering of pears, and the tale was recited in
order to secure a good harvest. In this case not
Jack, but <i>der Jäger</i>, "the huntsman," was dispatched
to knock the pears off, and the sequence
of powers included dog, stick, fire, water, calf,
butcher, hangman, devil.</p>

<p>This adoption by the Church of the sequence
of powers shows that we have to do with the
remains of a heathen ritual, which found its way
into a Christian celebration, as the tale of the
kid found its way into the Easter celebration of
the Jewish Church. In both instances the
sequence of relative powers is preserved, and in
both it is question of making an object secure
for the use of man.</p>

<p>The same sequence of powers is preserved also
in the traditional game that is known as <i>Dump</i>
among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
 ourselves (1894, I, 117; II, 419), and
as <i>Club Fist</i> in America (N., p. 134). In this
game it is also a question of building a house,
and of knocking off pears. The action of the
players, however, stands in no obvious relation to
the words that are used. Sometimes three, sometimes
a number of lads, crowd together and place
their fists sideways one on the other, till they
form a pile of clenched hands. The last boy, who
has a fist free, knocks off the fists one by one,
saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">(In Yorkshire) What's this?&mdash;(Answer) Dump.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(In America) What's that?&mdash;(Answer) A pear.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Take it off or I'll knock it off.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Shropshire all sing together:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">I've built my house, I've built my wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I don't care where my chimneys fall.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When all the fists are knocked down, the
following dialogue ensues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="small"><p class="hang2">What's there?&mdash;Cheese and bread and a mouldy half-penny.</p>

<p class="hang2">Where's my share?&mdash;I put it on the shelf, and the cat
got it.</p>

<p class="hang2">Where's the cat?&mdash;She's run nine miles through the wood.</p>

<p class="hang2">Where's the wood?&mdash;T' fire burnt it.</p>

<p class="hang2">Where's<span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
 the fire?&mdash;T' water sleckt it.</p>

<p class="hang2">Where's the water?&mdash;T' ox drunk it.</p>

<p class="hang2">Where's the ox?&mdash;T' butcher killed 'em.</p>

<p class="hang2">Where's the butcher?&mdash;Upon the church-top cracking
nuts, and you may go and eat the shells; and <i>them
as</i> speak first shall have nine nips, nine scratches,
and nine boxes on the ear.</p>

<p class="deepind small">
(1849, p. 128.)<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Silence falls, all try not to laugh, and he who
first allows a word to escape him, is punished by
the others in the methods adopted by schoolboys.
In the Scottish game the punishment is described
as "nine nips, nine nobs, nine double douncornes,
and a good blow on the back."</p>

<p>In France the same game is known as <i>Le Pied
de B&#339;uf</i>, "the foot of the ox," and a scramble
of fists starts at the words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Neuf, je tiens mon pied de b&#339;uf.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(Mo., p. 351.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"Nine, I hold my ox's foot";</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">the number nine in this case being also mentioned.</p>

<p>The meting out of punishments by nines goes far
back in history. It was associated with a Yule-tide
sport which is still practised in Denmark and in
Schleswig, and is known as <i>Ballerrune</i> or <i>Balderrune</i>.
Every member of the assembled company
repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
 a formula on "Balder Rune and his wife,"
and he who made a mistake received nine blows,
as in our game. The custom was explained by
the legend that the god Balder, incensed at his
wife's loquacity, chastised her by giving her nine
blows, and ordered that this should be repeated
every year, so that women be reminded that it is
their duty to be silent when their husbands
speak (H., p. 44).</p>

<p>In the game of <i>Dump</i> also, it is the person who
speaks first that is punished, but there is nothing
to suggest that this was a woman, for the game is
essentially a boys' game.</p>

<p>The story of <i>The Woman and her Pig</i> (<i>or Kid</i>),
like that of Jack, is told over a wide geographical
area. In the Scottish version the woman lived in
a wee house and found two pennies and bought
a kid. On coming home she saw a bush and
wished to pull off its berries, and could not. She
set the kid to watch the house, and went to seek
the help of dog, stick, fire, water, ox, axe, smith,
rope, mouse, cat, milk, in her hope of breaking
the spell that had fallen on the bush. Each
animal or object refused "to do the next one
harm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
 saying that it never did it any harm
itself"; but the cat finally could not resist the
temptation of lapping the milk (1870, p. 57).
Thus the tale introduced a moral element which
is not found elsewhere.</p>

<p>In Sweden the tale of <i>The Old Woman and her
Pig</i> is called <i>Konen och Grisen Fick</i>, "the woman
and her pig Fick," and the pig refused to leave
off eating acorns. A similar tale is called <i>Gossen
och Geten Näppa</i>, "the lad and the kid Näppa,"
(1849, p. 6). In Elsass the pig is called <i>Schnirrchele</i>
(St., p. 93), in Transylvania it is <i>Mischka</i> or
<i>Bitschki</i> (Sch., p. 372). And a version from the
north of France tells how <i>Biquette</i> got into a
cabbage-patch from which stick, fire, water, were
summoned to expel her. <i>Biquette</i> is described as
a kid (D., p. 122). In Languedoc <i>Biquette</i> reappears
as <i>Bouquaire-Bouquil</i>, who is furnished
with horns and does havoc in a millet-field from
which he is expelled with the help of wolf, dog,
stick, fire, water, ox, rope (M. L., p. 538). In all
cases the animal is one that is provided with
horns. Millet is one of the oldest cereals that
were cultivated in Europe, the displacement of
which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
 by the cultivation of corn had begun in
England when Pytheas visited these shores in the
fourth century B.C. Can the "malt" of <i>This is
the House that Jack built</i> stand for millet?</p>

<p>A French piece is current in Remiremont
which is called <i>Le Conjurateur et le Loup</i>,
"the magician and the wolf." It describes the
contest between them, and shows that the
making and unmaking of spells is involved:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">L'y a un loup dedans le bois,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Le loup ne veut pas sortir du bois.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Ha, j' te promets, compèr' Brocard,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Tu sortiras de ce lieu-là.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(R., p. 152.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"There is a wolf in the wood, the wolf will not come
out of the wood. Ha, I promise you, brother Brocard,
you will soon come out."</p></blockquote>

<p>And the magician summons to his assistance
stick, fire, water, calf, butcher, devil, which help
him to expel the wolf.</p>

<p>Even more primitive than this tale is one
current in Languedoc, in which a spell has
fallen on a root or turnip, which is finally raised
by the hog. It begins: "The old woman went
into the garden in order to pull out a turnip.
When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
 the old man saw that the old woman did
not come back, he went into the garden and saw
the old woman pulling at the turnip. The old
man pulled at the old woman, the old woman
pulled at the turnip, but the turnip stuck fast."
They were followed by daughter-in-law, son, man,
maid, and so forth, including the cat and the rat.
Finally the hog came to the rescue. Instead of
pulling like the others, he attacked the turnip
from below, and by doing so he succeeded in
raising it, otherwise the spell would continue,
"and the root would still be holding fast" (M. L.,
p. 541).</p>

<p>The comparison of these various tales or pieces
shows that dog, stick, fire, water, ox, butcher,
form a sequence of powers that was accepted
over a wide geographical area. They were
invoked wherever it was question of breaking
a spell that had fallen on a coveted object, the
object including pigs, pears, oats, berries, millet,
and roots. These are products that were prized
in Europe from a remote period in antiquity.
As the products are primitive, so probably is the
form of verse in which the story is told of their
being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
 made fast. For the same form of verse
is used in a further class of pieces to which we
now turn, and which, by their contents, betray a
pre-Christian origin.</p>

<p class="chap">CHANTS OF NUMBERS</p>


<p class="cap noin">AMONG our traditional games, some consist
of a dialogue in which the answer is set in
cumulative form. These include the game known
as <i>The Twelve Days of Christmas</i>, which was
played on Twelfth-Day night by the assembled
company before eating mince-pies and twelfth
cake. In the game of <i>Twelve Days</i> each player
in succession repeated the gifts of the day, and
raised his fingers and hand according to the
number which he named. Each answer included
the one that had gone before, and forfeits were
paid for each mistake that was made. (1894, II, 315.)</p>

<p>The oldest printed version of the words used in
playing <i>Twelve Days</i> stands in one of the diminutive
toy-books exhibited at South Kensington
Museum by E. Pearson. These words begin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
<span class="i2">The first day of Christmas, my true love gave me<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A partridge in a pear-tree.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The second day of Christmas, my true love gave me<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Two turtle-doves and a partridge in a pear-tree.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">And so forth, enumerating three French hens,
four colly birds, five gold rings, six geese a-laying,
seven swans a-swimming, eight maids a-milking,
nine drummers drumming, ten pipers piping,
eleven ladies dancing, twelve lords leaping.</p>

<p>The same game is played in Scotland, where it
is known as <i>The Yule Days</i>, but is carried on to
thirteen.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The king sent his lady on the first Yule day<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A papingo-aye [i.e. peacock or parrot]<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who learns my carol and carries it away?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The king sent his lady on the second Yule day<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Two partridges and a papingo-aye.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(1870, p. 42.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On the third day he sent three plovers;
on the fourth, a goose that was grey; on the fifth,
three starlings; on the sixth, three goldspinks;
on the seventh, a bull that was brown; on the
eighth, three ducks a-merry laying; on the ninth,
three swans a-merry swimming; on the tenth, an
Arabian baboon; on the eleventh, three hinds
a-merry dancing; on the twelfth, two maids a-merry
dancing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
 on the thirteenth three stalks of
corn.</p>

<p>In Cambresis, in the North of France, the same
game is called <i>Les dons de l'an</i>, "the gifts of the
year," but the gifts correspond in number with
the number of the day. They are: one partridge,
two turtle-doves, three wood-pigeons, four ducks
flying, five rabbits trotting, six hares a-field, seven
hounds running, eight shorn sheep, nine horned
oxen, ten good turkeys, eleven good hams, twelve
small cheeses (D. B., II, 125).</p>

<p>In the West of France the piece is described
as a song. It is called <i>La foi de la loi</i>, that is,
"the creed of authority," and is sung <i>avec solennité</i>.
It begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">La premièr' parti' d'la foi de la loi,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Dit' la moi, frère Grégoire.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&mdash;Un bon farci sans os&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">La deuxième parti' d'la foi de la loi,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Dit' le moi, frère Grégoire<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&mdash;Deux ventres de veau,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Un bon farci sans os.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(B., II, 271.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"The first part of the creed of authority, tell it me,
Brother Gregory. A good stuffing without bones. The
second part of the creed of authority ... two breasts
of veal."</p></blockquote>

<p>And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
 so forth, enumerating three joints of beef,
four pig's trotters, five legs of mutton, six
partridges with cabbage, seven spitted rabbits,
eight plates of salad, nine plates of (? <i>chapitre</i>),
ten full casks, eleven beautiful full-breasted
maidens, twelve knights with their rapiers.</p>

<p>The same conceptions underlie a Languedoc
chant, in which the numbers are, however, carried
on to fifteen. The gifts in this case are made
on the first fifteen days of the month of May:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Le prumiè del més de mai,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Qu'embouiarei à mai mio.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Uno perdic que bolo, que bolo.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(M. L., p. 486.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"The first of the month of May, what shall I send to
my lady love?&mdash;A partridge that flies and flies."</p></blockquote>

<p>And similarly we read of two doves, three
white pigeons, four ducks flying in the air, five
rabbits, six hares, seven hunting dogs, eight
white horses, nine horned oxen, ten bleating
sheep, eleven soldiers coming from war, twelve
maidens, thirteen white nosegays, fourteen white
loaves, fifteen casks of wine.</p>

<p>The contents of these chants at first sound like
nonsense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
 but on looking at them more closely
one notes that the gifts which they enumerate
mostly consist of birds and beasts that are
conceived as food. We know that the weather
on Twelve Days was carefully observed, since the
weather of the months of the ensuing year was
prognosticated from that of the corresponding day
of the twelve.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> A like conception perhaps underlies
these enumerations of food, which may refer
to the representative sports of the months.</p>

<p>The game of <i>Twelve Days</i> in a degraded form
is known as <i>The Gaping Wide-mouthed Waddling
Frog</i>, in which the crux likewise consists of
answering the question with rapidity and exactness.
But words are purposely chosen that are
difficult to enunciate and to remember. The
result is a string of nonsense. The words used
in playing <i>The Gaping Wide-mouthed Waddling
Frog</i> were first printed in a toy-book of the
eighteenth century. Persons who are still living
remember it in this form as a Christmas game.
As in playing <i>Twelve Days</i>, the players sat in
a circle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
 a dialogue ensued, and the answers were
given in cumulative form. He who made a mistake
gave a forfeit.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Buy this of me:&mdash;What is it?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The gaping wide-mouthed waddling frog.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Buy this of me:&mdash;What is it?<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Three monkeys tied to a clog,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Two pudding ends will choke a dog, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The answer to the last question stood as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Twelve huntsmen with horns and hounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hunting over other men's grounds;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Two pudding ends would choke a dog;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a gaping wide-mouthed waddling frog.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Many rhymes that originated in these nonsense
verses have found their way into nursery collections.
Halliwell printed the following lines as a
separate nursery rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Eight ships on the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I wish them all safe back again;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Seven eagles in the air,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">I don't know, nor I don't care.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">With a gaping wide mouthed waddling frog.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(1842, p.246.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Halliwell also printed some utterly debased
rhymes, in which, however, numbers are still
combined with the objects that are named.
Among these rhymes is the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
<span class="i2">One old Oxford ox opening oysters;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Two teetotums totally tired of trying to trot to Tadbury;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Three tall tigers tippling tenpenny tea;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Four fat friars fanning fainting flies;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">And so on to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Twelve typographical typographers typically translating types.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(1846, p. 111.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Other rhymes of this kind depend for their
consistency on alliteration only, such as:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Robert Rowley rolled a round roll round,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A round roll Robert Rowley rolled round;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where rolled the round roll Robert Rowley rolled round.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(1842, p. 128.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Robert Rowley is perhaps a name for thunder,
since a rhyme recited in the North of England as
a charm against thunder is:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Rowley, Rowley, Rattley-bags;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Take the lasses and leave the lads.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(1876, p. 15.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another rhyme of this class begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled pepper, etc.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(1842, p. 129.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the time-honoured rhyme, "When a
twister a twisting," etc., has been traced back by
Halliwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
 to a collection of 1674. This has a
French parallel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Si un cordonnier accordant veut accorder sa corde, etc.<br /></span>

<p class="chap">CHANTS OF THE CREED</p>


<p class="cap noin">THE game of <i>Twelve Days</i>, especially in one
French version, shows that instruction was
conveyed by the cumulative mode of recitation.
There are many pieces enlarging on matters
of belief&mdash;Hebrew, Christian, Druidical, and
heathen&mdash;which in the same way associate numbers
with objects. The comparison of these pieces
suggests that they are all derived from one
original source. They may fitly be termed
Chants of the Creed.</p>

<p>One of these cumulative chants is included in
the Hebrew service for the night of the Passover,
which is called <i>Echod mi jodea</i>, "He who knows."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
It is recited to a monotonous tune after the
return of the family from celebration, either by
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
 master of the house or by the assembled
company. The dialogue form, I am told, is no
longer observed. The piece begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Who knoweth One?&mdash;I, saith Israel, know One.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One is God, who is over heaven and earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who knoweth Two?&mdash;I, saith Israel, know Two.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Two tables of the covenant; but One is our God who is over the heavens and the earth....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And so forth to the last verse, which is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="small"><p>Who knoweth thirteen?&mdash;I, saith Israel, know thirteen:
Thirteen divine attributes&mdash;twelve tribes&mdash;eleven
stars&mdash;ten commandments&mdash;nine months preceding childbirth&mdash;eight
days preceding circumcision&mdash;seven days of
the week&mdash;six books of the Mishnah&mdash;five books of the
Law&mdash;four matrons&mdash;three patriarchs&mdash;two tables of the
covenant&mdash;but One is our God, who is over the heavens
and the earth.</p></blockquote>

<p>The same chant adapted to matters of Christian
belief, but carried only from one to twelve,
is current also in Latin, Italian, Spanish, French,
German, and Danish. Among ourselves it is set
as a song. But the objects which are associated
with the numbers are not uniformly the same,
and this renders it probable that the chants were
composed independently of one another. This
view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
 is supported by the fact that some of the
items that are named in the Christian chants are
not Christian, and are, in fact, identical with the
items named in the entirely heathen chants.</p>

<p>The Latin version of the Chant of the Creed has
been traced back to the second half of the sixteenth
century. Its words were set to music in a
motet for thirteen voices by Theodor Clinius
(d. 1602), a Venetian by birth (E., p. 408).
Another Latin version of the chant goes back
to 1650. The chant begins:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="small"><p>Dic mihi quid unus?</p>

<p>&mdash;Unus est Jesus Christus [<i>or</i> Deus] qui regnat in
aeternum [<i>or</i> coelis]. (A., I, 420.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"Tell me, what is One? One is Jesus Christ [<i>or</i> God]
who reigns in eternity [<i>or</i> in heaven]."</p></blockquote>

<p>The answers further explain two as the testaments,
three as the patriarchs, four as the evangelists,
five as the books of Moses, six as the
water-jugs of Cana in Galilee, seven as the gifts
of the spirit (<i>or</i> the candelabra lit before God),
eight as the beatitudes, nine as the orders (<i>or</i>
choirs of the angels), ten as the commandments,
eleven as the disciples (<i>or</i> stars seen by Joseph),
twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
 as the articles of the faith (<i>or</i> the
apostles).</p>

<p>The Chant of the Creed as recited in Spain
(A., II, 142) is set in the same form, and explains
the numbers in much the same manner,
except that six are the days of the Creation, and
eleven are eleven thousand virgins. Another
version (A., II, 104) associates the Virgin with
one, the three Maries with three, while nine, like
the Hebrew chant, indicates the months of expectancy
of the Virgin. In a Portuguese version
also, nine are the months of Christ's becoming,
and eleven are eleven thousand virgins (A., II,
102).</p>

<p>Throughout Italy and in Sicily the Chant of
the Creed is known as <i>Le dodici parole della
Verità</i>, "the twelve words of truth." They are
generally put into the lips of the popular saint,
Nicolas of Bari, who is said to have defeated the
evil intentions of Satan by teaching them. These
Italian chants for the most part agree with the
Latin chant already cited, except that two in
the Abruzzi is associated with the sun and the
moon; five is explained as the wounds of Jesus
<i>or</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
 of St. Francis, and eleven stands for the
articles of the Catholic faith (A., I, 419; II, 97).</p>

<p>In Denmark the Chant of the Creed is put into
the lips of St. Simeon, and begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stat op, Sante Simeon, og sig mig, hvad een er?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"Stand forth, St. Simeon, and tell me, what is one."</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">The explanations in this case are strictly Christian,
Jesus Christ standing for One. The souls saved
by God from the ark (<i>sjaele frelste Gud udi Arken</i>)
stand for eight (Gt., II, 68).</p>

<p>In Languedoc also the chant is current in a
Christian adaptation which agrees with the Latin,
except that the Trinity stands for three; the
wounds of Jesus, as in the Italian chant, stand
for five; the lights in the temple stand for six;
and the joys of our Lady stand for seven (M. L.,
p. 478).</p>

<p>From Europe the Chant of the Creed has been
carried to Canada, where a version is sung in
French to a monotonous tune in four beats at a
formal kind of dance, called a <i>ronde religieuse</i>&mdash;a
religious round. To this dance six couples stand
up; each dancer represents a number. To the
sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
 of their singing they move in a chain, each
person turning first to the right, then to the left.
When number six is reached in singing, and every
time that six recurs in the chant, the dancing
stops, and to the words "<i>six urnes de vin remplies</i>,"
the dancers who represent even numbers
turn first to the right, then to the left, and make
a deep bow, while those that represent uneven
numbers perform the same ceremony the other
way about (G., p. 298). Then the dancing is
resumed. This figure, judging from the description,
exactly corresponds to the Grand Chain in
Lancers, except that six couples dance instead
of four or eight.</p>

<p>In the Canadian chant the explanations of the
numbers are all Christian, except that for eleven
they say eleven thousand virgins, which agrees
with the virgins of the Spanish and Portuguese
chants. These eleven thousand virgins are mentioned
also in a version of the chant current in
Zürich, which, unlike the others, carries the
numbers to fifteen. It enumerates Christian
matters similar to those already named as far
as nine choirs of angels, and further associates
ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
 with thousands of knights, eleven with thousands
of virgins, the apostles with twelve, the
disciples with thirteen, the helpers in need (<i>Nothelfer</i>)
with fourteen, the mysteries with fifteen.
This chant is set in the old way of question and
answer, and the answers are recited in cumulative
form (R., p. 268).</p>

<p>The Chant of the Creed in a late development
is preserved in the form of a religious poem
among ourselves which is called <i>A New Dyall</i>.
Two versions of it are preserved in the MS.
Harleian 5937, which dates from about the year
1625. They have been printed by F. S. A.
Sandys among his <i>Christmas Carols</i>. The refrain
of the one recalls the celebration of Twelve
Days:&mdash;</p>

<p>The objects named in this poem agree in most
cases with those of the Latin chant, but six, there
associated with the water-jugs in Cana of Galilee,
is here associated with the days of the Creation,
which correspond with the six days of the Creation
of the Spanish Chant of the Creed, and with the
six working days of the week of a heathen dialogue
story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
 to which we shall return later. The
number eight is here associated with the persons
saved in the ark of Noah, as in the Chant of the
Creed which is current in Denmark.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="chap">HEATHEN CHANTS OF THE CREED</p>


<p class="cap noin">WE now turn to those versions of the Chant
of the Creed which are heathen in character.
Again we have versions before us in the
vernacular of Brittany, Spain, Scotland, and
several set in the form of songs that are current
in different parts of England.</p>

<p>The most meaningful and elaborate versions of
the chant come from Brittany. One is called
<i>Les vêpres des grenouilles</i>. It is set in the form
of instruction, and begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Can caer, Killoré. Iolic, petra faot dide?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Caera traïc a gement orizoud ti.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(L., I, p. 95.)</span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"Chant well, Killore. Iolic, what shall I sing?&mdash;The
most beautiful thing thou knowest."</p></blockquote>

<p>And it enumerates, "One silver ring to Mary,
two silver rings, three queens in a palace, four
acolytes, five black cows, six brothers and six
sisters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
 seven days and seven moons, eight beaters
of the air, nine armed sons, ten ships on the
shore, eleven sows, twelve small swords." This
combination of objects with numbers from one
to twelve agrees most closely with the enumeration
of the game of <i>Twelve Days</i>.</p>

<p>The longer version of the Breton chant was
interpreted by its editor as a chant of instruction,
and he claimed for it a Druidical origin. It
begins:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="small"><p class="hang2">Beautiful child of the Druid, answer me right well.</p>

<p class="hang2">&mdash;What would'st thou that I should sing?&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang2">Sing to me the series of number one, that I may learn
it this very day.</p>

<p class="hang2">&mdash;There is no series for one, for One is Necessity alone,
the father of death, there is nothing before and
nothing after.</p></blockquote>

<p>And we read of two as oxen yoked to a cart;
of three as the beginning, the middle, and the
end of the world for man and for the oak; also
of the three kingdoms of Merlin; of four as the
stones of Merlin for sharpening the swords of the
brave; of five as the terrestrial zones, the divisions
of time, the rocks on one sister (<i>sic</i>); of six as
babes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
 of wax quickened into life through the
power of the moon; of seven as the suns, the
moons, and the planets, including <i>La Poule</i> (i.e.
the constellation) of Charles's Wain; of eight as
the winds that blow, eight fires with the great
fire lighted in the month of May on the War
Mountain; of nine as little white hands near the
tower of Lezarmeur, and as maidens who groan;
of nine also as maidens who dance with flowers
in their hair and in white robes around the
well by the light of the moon; 'the wild sow
and her young at the entrance to their lair, are
snorting and snarling, snarling and snorting;
little one, little one, hurry to the apple-tree, the
wild boar will instruct you'; of ten as the enemy's
boats on the way from Nantes, 'woe to you, woe
to you, men of Vannes'; of eleven as priests
'coming from Vannes with broken swords and
blood-stained garments, and crutches of hazel-wood,
of three hundred only these eleven ones
are left'; of twelve as months and signs, 'Sagittarius,
the one before the last, lets fly his pointed
arrow. The twelve signs are at war. The black
cow with a white star on her forehead rushes
from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
 the forest (<i>des despouillés</i>) pierced by a
pointed arrow, her blood flows, she bellows with
raised head. The trumpet sounds, fire and
thunder, rain and wind. No more, no more,
there is no further series.' (H. V., p. 1.)</p>

<p>The contents of this chant in several particulars
agree with the shorter one. Seven stands for
days, eight for winds, and ten for boats.</p>

<p>A similar chant comes from Spain, which gives
the answers with a curious variation. For in this
case most of the numbers are explained as one
less of one kind and one more of another. Thus
one stands for the Wheel of Fortune; two for
one clock and bell; three for the handle of a
mortar (? <i>la mano del almiles</i>); four for three
basins and one dish; five for three jars of red
wine and two of white (<i>or</i> for the wounds of
St. Francis); six for the loves you hold (<i>amores
que teneis</i>); seven for six cassocks and a cape;
eight for seven butchers and one sheep; nine
for eight hounds and one hare; ten for the toes;
eleven for ten horsemen and one leader (<i>breva</i>,
? acorn); twelve are probably pigs.</p>

<p>Exactly as in the other chants the numbers
are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
 set in question and answer, the answer being
in cumulative form:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Quién me dirá que no es una?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">La rued de la fortuna.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(Ma., p. 68.)</span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"Who will tell me what is one?&mdash;One is the Wheel of
Fortune," and so forth.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this Spanish version there is the alternative
of associating five with the jars of wine of Cana
or with the wounds of St. Francis, both of which
are Christian conceptions that occur in the Christian
chants&mdash;the wounds of St. Francis in the
Italian chant, and the jugs of wine, six in
number, in the chant as it is sung and danced
in Canada. Christian conceptions are also introduced
into some of the numerous versions of the
heathen Chants of the Creed that are current
among ourselves, but they are relatively few, and
by their nature suggest a change from heathen
to Christian matters of belief.</p>

<p>The oldest version of this chant was printed
by Chambers from an unpublished collection of
songs by P. Buchan. It is in dialogue form,
and, as in the case of the Druidical chants, its
words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
 indicate a teacher who is instructing his
pupils:&mdash;</p>

<p>Further variations of this chant have been recovered
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
 Dorsetshire, Cornwall, Derbyshire, Norfolk,
and elsewhere. Many of them at the close
of each line insert the interjection <i>O</i> in the place
of the word <i>boys</i>. This drew the suggestion
from Dr. Jessopp that the song was connected
with the so-called <i>Seven great Os</i>, a song sung at
vespers during Advent before the <i>Magnificat</i>
from 16 December to Christmas Eve. It took
its name from the first line in the song, which
begins <i>O Sapientia</i>.</p>

<p>The Dorsetshire version is still sung at Eton,
and is known as "Green grow the rushes oh,"
the words that form the chorus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="lmargin">
Solo: <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I'll sing you one oh!</span></p>

<p class="lmargin">Chorus: <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Green grow the rushes oh!<br /></span>

</p>

<p>The same order is observed for the next verse,
the soloist explaining two, the chorus adding
one, and so forth. In this version we have two
lily-white boys, three rivals, four gospel makers,
five symbols at your door, six proud walkers, seven
stars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
 in the sky, eight bold rainers, nine bright
shiners, ten commandments, eleven for the eleven
that went up to heaven, twelve for the twelve
apostles.</p>

<p>A Chant of the Creed is sung in Cornwall by
the sailors, and begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Come and I will sing you!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">&mdash;What will you sing me?<br /></span>

gospel-makers; five are the ferrymen in a boat

<p>In Derbyshire the chant is associated with the
harvest festival, and takes the form of a drinking
song.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
 It begins with three, but the explanations
of one and two are preserved in the last verse,

</div></div>

<p>The last verse enumerates:&mdash;Twelve apostles;
eleven archangels; ten commandments; nine
bright shiners; eight, the Gabriel riders; seven
golden stars in heaven; six came on the board;
five by water; four Gospel rhymers; three threble

<p>The tabulation of the explanations of numbers
of these various songs will give an idea of the

<p>From this table we see that the <i>thrivers</i> of
Scotland are <i>threble thribers</i> in Derbyshire. These,
according to the explanation of Addy, are the three
Norns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
 or white ladies,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and this view is supported
by the <i>three queens</i> of the one Breton chant,
which probably suggested <i>The Three Maries</i> of
the one Spanish version.</p>

<p>Again, the <i>table rangers</i> of the Scottish song
are <i>Gabriel riders</i>, otherwise known as <i>Gabriel
hounds</i> or <i>gabbe ratches</i> in Derbyshire. <i>Gabriel
hounds</i> is a word applied to the winds. The winds
are also associated with eight in the one Breton
chant. In Cornwall <i>bright shiners</i> are associated
with three, but in Dorsetshire and Derbyshire
<i>bright shiners</i> are associated with nine, and nine
is the number of maidens in one Breton chant
also. We are reminded of the priestesses who
were devoted to religious rites on some island
of the Atlantic, perhaps Ushant, off Brittany,
when Pytheas, in the fourth century before Christ,
visited these shores. Nine of them attended a
famous oracle, and professed to control the
weather.</p>

<p>The interest of these chants is increased when
we compare them with what folk-lore preserves
on the subject. The followers of Mohammed
tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
 a tale which describes how a rich man
promised a poor man his ox if he could explain
to him the numbers, and the following dialogue
ensued:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="small"><p class="hang2">What is one and not two?&mdash;God is one.</p>

<p class="hang2">What is two and not three?&mdash;Day and night [<i>or</i> the sun
and the moon].</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">And further: three for divorces from one's wife;
four for the Divine books (i.e. the Old and New
Testament, the Psalter and the Koran); five for
the states of Islam; six for the realms in Nizam;
seven for the heavens that surround the throne
of God (A., II, 230).</p>

<p>The same story in a more primitive form is
told in Ditmarschen, a district bordering on
Holstein, in which also the numbers are carried
to seven only. But in this case a peasant's
property stood forfeited to the "little man in
grey," unless he found an explanation to the
numbers. He despaired of doing so, when Christ
intervened and instructed him as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>One stands for wheelbarrow; two stands for a
cart; three for a trivet; four for a waggon; five
stands for the fingers of the hand; six for the
working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
 days of the week; seven for the stars of
the Great Bear. And the peasant remained in
the possession of his goods (R., p. 137).</p>

<p>More primitive still is the story as told in
Little Russia. In this case a man bartered away
his soul for six pigs. After three years the devil
came to fetch him. But the devil was met by an
old, old man who successfully cheated him of his
due. The dialogue between them was: "Who is
in the house?&mdash;One and not one (that is two).
And how about two?&mdash;It is well to thrash two at
a time. It is well to travel three at a time. He
who has four has a waggon. He who has five sons
has company. Six pigs the devil had, but he left
them with a poor man, and now he has lost them
for ever" (A., II, 227).</p>

<p>The comparison of these stories with the
Chants of the Creed shows that the dialogue
stories are older in contents, and probably in
form also, than the cumulative pieces. In both,
superhuman power is conveyed by associating
numbers with objects. This power in the dialogue
pieces is attributed to the "little man in
grey" of the German piece, who may be intended
for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
 Death, and to the devil in the Russian piece.
In the pieces where numbers are associated with
Christian articles of belief, the superhuman power
is attributed to a popular saint, viz. St. Simeon
in Denmark and St. Nicholas in Italy, who make
use of their power to overcome Satan.</p>

<p>The dialogue stories explain the numbers only
as far as six or seven. This in itself indicates
that they are relatively early. Some of the explanations
they contain reappear in the cumulative
Chants of the Creed, both in their Christian
and in their heathen variations. Thus the "one
wheel" of the wheelbarrow in the German dialogue
story, reappears as the Wheel of Fortune
in the Spanish chant, and as the "One that walks
alone" of the Scottish chant. Perhaps this idea
underlies the one O, or circle of our late English
songs also. Two in the dialogue story is explained
as a cart; one Breton Chant of the Creed
associates two with an ox-cart also. In the
Mohammedan dialogue story two is explained as
the sun and moon, and this explanation reappears
in the Christian chant as sung in the Abruzzi.
Six, which the German dialogue story explains as
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
 working days of the week, has the same meaning
in our song of the <i>New Dyall</i>. Seven, which
the German dialogue story associates with the constellation
of Charles's Wain, reappears as <i>La
Poule</i> in the Breton Chant of the Creed, as seven
bright shiners in our English songs, and as the
stars seen by Joseph in the Latin Chant.</p>

<p>These points of likeness cannot be due to mere
chance; they indicate a relationship between all
the pieces which associate objects with numbers.
There has been some discussion as to which
Chant of the Creed has the greater claim to
priority&mdash;whether the Breton was based on the
Christian, or the Christian on the Hebrew, and
how these stand in relation to the various heathen
chants. But the analysis of these pieces renders
it probable that they are all derived from an
earlier prototype, and this prototype is perhaps
to be sought in the dialogue stories. For in the
Chants of the Creed the explanations of the
numbers are often abstract in meaning, whereas
in the dialogue pieces they are simple objects,
mostly wheels or circles, which may well have
appeared magical in themselves to the primitive
mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
 Again, the purpose of the Chants of the
Creed is to convey religious instruction as a
protection against the devil, while in the dialogue
stories in the last instance the theme is the
acquisition of pigs, and pigs were esteemed
valuable possessions from a remote period of
antiquity.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="chap">SACRIFICIAL HUNTING</p>


<p class="cap noin">MANY nursery rhymes and pieces relate to
sacrificial hunting. This hunting goes
back to the time when certain animals were
looked upon as tabu in that they were generally
held in reverence, and ill-luck befell him who
wittingly or unwittingly did them harm. At the
same time one animal of the kind was periodically
slain. It was actually killed, but its spirit was
held to be incarnate in other creatures of its kind,
and it therefore continued to be spoken of as
alive.</p>

<p>The custom of killing the divine animal belongs
to an early stage of social evolution, since it
stands in no relation to agriculture, and perhaps
took rise before men tilled the soil. The animal
that was slaughtered was generally looked upon
as the representative of a certain clan, or as
constituting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
 the bond between a number of
kinsmen.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Among the creatures that were sacrificially
hunted in different parts of Western Europe were
a number of small birds. Many of our nursery
pieces relate to the hunting of the wren. A
peculiar importance was attached to this bird from
a remote period in antiquity, possibly on account of
the golden crest worn by one kind of these birds.
This importance was expressed by the term "little
king." In Greek the wren was <span lang="el" title="Greek: basiliskos">
&#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span>, in
Latin he was <i>regulus</i> or <i>rex avium</i>. In France he
is <i>roitelet</i>; in Italy he is <i>reatino</i>; in Spain he is
<i>reyezuolo</i>; in Germany he is <i>zaunkönig</i>; in Wales
he is <i>bren</i>, a word allied to our wren. The sacrifice
of a bird that was so highly esteemed, must
have a deeper significance. Possibly his sacrifice
was accepted in the place of the periodical sacrifice
of the real king, a primitive custom which
dates far back in history. If so, the practice of
slaying the wren represents the custom of killing
the king "of the woods" at a later stage of
development.</p>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
 designation of king as applied to the wren
naturally called for an explanation. It was
accounted for by the story according to which
the birds challenged one another as to who could
fly highest. The eagle flew higher than the other
birds, but the diminutive wren hid beneath his
wing, and, being carried up by the eagle, started
on his own flight when the eagle tired, and
so proved his superiority (Ro., II, 293). The
story dates from the period when cunning was
esteemed higher than brute force, and when
cheating was accepted as a legitimate way of
showing one's powers. Among the fairy tales of
Grimm one tells how the wren, whose young had
been spoken of disrespectfully by the bear,
challenged the four-footed beasts of the forest,
and by a similar strategem proved his superiority
over them also (No. 152). Thus the kingship of
the wren extended to the four-footed as well as to
the feathered tribes.</p>

<p>The lines that celebrate the <i>Hunting of the
Wren</i> are included in several of the oldest nursery
collections. They depend for their consistency on
repetition; there is no attempt at cumulation.
In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>

<p>Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>

back to 1776.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> In this the wren "is slayed,"
"conveyed home in carts and horse," and is got in
by "driving down the door cheeks." The characters
in this case are Fozie Mozie, Johnie Rednosie,
Foslin 'ene, and brethren and kin. The
song ends:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the toy-book literature of the eighteenth

<p>Further variations of the chant have been recovered
from the Isle of Man and from Ireland,
where the hunt is kept up to this day. In the
Isle of Man it used to take place on 24 December,
though afterwards on St. Stephen's Day, that is
27 December, which according to the old reckoning
was the beginning of the New Year.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> On this
day people left the church at midnight and then
engaged in hunting the wren. When the bird
was secured, it was fastened to a long pole with
its wings extended, and it was carried about in
procession to the singing of the chant:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">We hunted the wren for Robin the Bobbin.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
 chant further describes that the bird was
hunted with sticks and stones, a cart was hired,
he was brought home, he was boiled in the
brewery-pan, he was eaten with knives and forks,
the king and the queen dined at the feast, and
the pluck went to the poor.</p>

<p>The behaviour of the huntsmen was not, however,
in keeping with these words; for the
bearers of the wren, after making the circuit,
laid it on a bier and carried it to the parish
churchyard, where it was buried with the utmost
solemnity, and dirges were sung over it
in the Manx language, which were called the
knell of the wren. The company then formed
a circle outside the churchyard and danced to
music.</p>

<p>In the middle of the nineteenth century the
wren was still hunted in the Isle of Man and was
carried by boys from door to door, suspended by
the legs in the centre of two hoops. These crossed
each other at right angles and were decorated
with evergreens and ribbons. The boys recited
the chant. In return for a coin they gave a
feather of the wren, so that before the end of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
 day the bird hung featherless. A superstitious
value was attached to these feathers, for
the possession of one of them was considered an
effective preservative from shipwreck during the
coming year among the sailors. At this time the
bird was no longer buried in the churchyard, but
on the seashore or in some waste place.</p>

<p>The hunt in the Isle of Man was accounted for
by the legend that in former times a fairy of
uncommon beauty exerted such influence over
the male population of the island that she
induced them by her sweet voice to follow her
footsteps, till by degrees she led them into the sea,
where they perished. At last a knight-errant
sprang up, who laid a plot for her destruction,
which she escaped at the last moment by taking
the form of a wren. But a spell was cast upon
her by which she was condemned on every
succeeding New Year's Day to reanimate the
same form, with the definite sentence that she
must ultimately perish by human hand. In this
form the legend is told by Train. Waldron
relates the same story, which explained why the
female sex are now held of little account in the
island,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
 but the fairy according to him was transformed
into a bat.</p>

<p>In Ireland also the wren was generally hunted
during the eighteenth century, and continues
to be hunted in Leinster and in Connaught,
but I have come across no chant of the hunt.
The bird was slain by the peasants, and was
carried about hung by the leg inside two crossed
hoops, and a custom rhyme was sung which
began:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">The wren, the wren, the king of all birds,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Was caught St. Stephen's Day in the furze;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Although he's little, his family's great,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then pray, gentlefolks, give him a treat.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(1849, p. 166.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The bird was slain, but it was not therefore
dead. This is conveyed by the tale told in the
Isle of Man, and by the following custom observed
in Pembrokeshire on 6 January, that is on
Twelfth Day. On this day one or several wrens
were secured in a small house or cage, sometimes
the stable lantern, which was decorated with
ribbons and carried from house to house while
the following lines were sung:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>

</div></div>

<p>On grouping together these various pieces, we
are struck by their likeness, and by the antiquity
of their allusions. The bird was usually slain
with stones and sticks, which are among the most
primitive weapons. In Wales <i>bows and arrows</i>,
which are old also, were declared preferable to
<i>cannons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
 and guns</i>. In Wales the bird was cut up
with <i>hatchets and cleavers</i> in preference to <i>knives
and forks</i>; it was boiled in the <i>brewery pan</i>, or in
<i>cauldrons and pans</i>, in preference to <i>kettles and
pots</i>; and it was conveyed about in a <i>waggon or
cart</i> in preference to being <i>carried on four men's
shoulders</i>. Sometimes the bird was plucked.
Finally it was cut up in a sacrificial manner; one
wing&mdash;another&mdash;one leg&mdash;another&mdash;and the spare
ribs or the pluck, as the least valuable part of the
feast, went to the poor.</p>

<p>The representative huntsmen in England are
Robbin, Bobbin, Richard, and John-all-alone.
In Scotland they are Fozie-Mozie, Johnie Rednosie,
and Foslin, besides "the brethren and
kin." In Wales they are Milder, Malder, Festel,
Fose, and John the Rednose. Of these characters
only Robin and Bobbin (the names are sometimes
run together) and Richard, reappear in other
nursery pieces. In the oldest collection of 1744
stand the lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Robbin and Bobbin, two great belly'd men,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">They ate more victuals than three-score men.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(1744, p. 25.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
 powers of eating perhaps refer to the
first share of these characters at the feast. They
are further dwelt on in the following nursery
rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="noin">To which some collections add:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">And yet he complained that his belly was not full.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Other pieces dilate on Robin and Richard as
lazy in starting, and on Robin, whose efforts as a
huntsman were attended with ill luck:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="deepind">(1890, p. 346.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Halliwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
 saw a relation between the huntsman
of this verse and the bird robin, since the robin
was reckoned to disappear at Christmas and not
to return till Midsummer. As a matter of fact,
the robin leaves the abodes of man and retires
into the woodland as soon as the sharp winter
frost is over. However this may be, the presence
of the wren and of the robin was mutually exclusive,
as we shall see in the pieces which deal with
the proposed union, the jealousy, and the death of
these two birds.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="chap">BIRD SACRIFICE</p>


<p class="cap noin">THE custom of slaying the wren is widespread
in France also. But the chants that
deal with it dwell, not like ours, on the actual
hunt, but on the sacrificial plucking and dividing
up of the bird. Moreover, the French chants
depend for their consistency not on repetition like
ours, but are set in cumulative form. Both in
contents and in form they seem to represent the
same idea in a later development.</p>

<p>At Entraigues, in Vaucluse, men and boys
hunted the wren on Christmas Eve, and when they
caught a bird alive they gave it to the priest, who
set it free in church. At Mirabeau the hunted
bird was blessed by the priest, and the curious
detail is preserved that if the first bird was
secured by a woman, this gave the sex the right
to jeer at and insult the men, and to blacken
their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
 faces with mud and soot if they caught
them. At Carcassonne, on the first Sunday of
December, the young people who dwelt in the
street of Saint-Jean went out of the town armed
with sticks and stones to engage in the hunt. The
first person who struck the bird was hailed king,
and carried the bird home in procession. On the
last of December he was solemnly introduced to
his office as king; on Twelfth Day he attended
mass in church, and then, crowned and girt about
with a cloak, he visited the various dignitaries of
the place, including the bishop and the mayor, in
a procession of mock solemnity. This was done
as late as 1819.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> This identification of the bird
and the men explains the hiring of a cart or
waggon to convey "the bird" in our own custom-rhymes.</p>

<p>The Breton chant on "plucking the wren,"
<i>Plumer le roitelet</i> begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Nin' ziblus bec al laouenanic<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Rac henès a zo bihanic | <i>bis.</i><br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(L., I, p. 72.)</span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"We will pluck the beak of the wren, for he is very
small," and continues, "We will pluck the left eye of the
wren, for he is very small".</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
 then enumerates right eye, left ear, right ear,
head, neck, chest, back, belly, left wing, right
wing, left buttock, right buttock, left thigh,
right thigh, left leg, right leg, left foot, right
foot, first claw of left foot and every claw in
succession of this and of the other foot. The
last sentence is "We will pluck the tail of the
wren," and then sentence after sentence is repeated
to the first, "We will pluck the beak of the
wren because he is very small, we have plucked
him altogether."</p>

<p>Another poem preserved in Breton relates how
the wren was caught and caged and fed till the
butcher and his comrades came and slew it, when
the revelry began (L., I, p. 7).</p>

<p>I have often wondered at the cruel sport of
confining singing birds in cages. Possibly this
goes back to a custom of fattening a victim that
was sacrificially slain. For the wren is tabu in
Brittany as among ourselves, and in popular
belief the nestlings of each brood assemble with
the parent birds in the nest on Twelfth Night, and
must on no account be disturbed. This reflects
the belief that the creature that is slain during
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
 winter solstice, at its close starts on a new
lease of life.</p>

<p>The wren is not the only bird that was sacrificially
eaten in France, judging from the chants
that are recorded. A chant on "plucking the
lark," <i>Plumer l'alouette</i>, is current in the north
of France which begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Nous la plumerons, l'alouette,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Nous la plumerons, tout de long.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(D. B., p. 124.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"We will pluck the lark, we will pluck it altogether."</p></blockquote>

<p>And it enumerates the bird's beak, eyes, head,
throat, back, wings, tail, legs, feet, claws.</p>

<p>A variation of the same chant is sung in
Languedoc, where it is called <i>L'alouette plumée</i>,
"the plucked lark," and is described as a game
(M. L., p. 457).</p>

<p>Again, the dividing up of the thrush forms
the subject of a chant which is sung in Brittany in
the north (L., I, p. 81), and in Languedoc in the
south. It is called <i>Dépecer le merle</i>, and preserves
the further peculiarity that the bird, although
it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
 is divided up, persists in singing. The version
current in Languedoc begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Le merle n'a perdut le bec, le merle n'a perdut le bec,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Comment fra-t-il, le merle, comment pourra-t-il chanter?<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Emai encaro canto, le pauvre merle, merle,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Emai encaro canto, le pauvre merlatou.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(M. L., p. 458.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"The thrush has lost his beak, how will he manage to
sing, and yet he sings, the poor thrush, yet he goes on
singing."</p></blockquote>

<p>The chant then enumerates the bird's tongue,
one eye, two eyes, head, neck, one wing, two
wings, one foot, two feet, body, back, feathers,
tail; always returning to the statement that
the bird, although it is divided up, persists in
singing.</p>

<p>The French word <i>merle</i> stands both for thrush
and for blackbird. The blackbird is held in
reverence among ourselves in Salop and Montgomeryshire,
and blackbird-pie was eaten in
Cornwall on Twelfth Night.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> But there is no
reference to the sacrificial slaying of the bird, as
far as I am aware. In the French chant the
bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
 continues to sing although it is killed. The
same idea finds expression in our nursery song of
<i>Sing a Song of Sixpence</i>. This piece, taken in
conjunction with the eating of blackbird-pie
in Cornwall and the French chants, seems to
preserve the remembrance of the ancient bird
sacrifice. The first verse of this rhyme appears
in the collection of 1744, in which "naughty
boys" stands for blackbirds. In other collections
the piece runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Sing a song of sixpence, a bagful of rye,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pye<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And when the pye was open'd, the birds began to sing;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Was not this a dainty dish to set before the king?<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The king was in his parlour counting out his money,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The queen was in the kitchen eating bread and honey,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The maid was in the garden hanging out the clothes,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Up came a magpie and bit off her nose.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(<i>c.</i> 1783, p. 26.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The magpie is "a little blackbird" in the
version of Halliwell, which continues:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Jenny was so mad, she didn't know what to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">She put her finger in her ear and cracked it right in two.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Halliwell (1842, p. 62) noted that in the book
called <i>Empulario or the Italian Banquet</i> of 1589,
there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
 is a receipt "to make pies so that the birds
may be alive in them and fly out when it is cut
up," a mere device, live birds being introduced
after the pie is made. One cannot but wonder if
the device was a mere sport of fancy, or if it
originated from the desire to give substance to an
ancient belief.</p>

<p>Again, the robin redbreast was sacrificially
eaten in France at Le Charme, Loiret, on
Candlemas, that is on February the first (Ro., II,
264). There are no chants on the sacrifice of
the robin in France, as far as I know. Among
ourselves, on the other hand, where no hunting of
the robin is recorded, a piece printed both by
Herd<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and Chambers suggests his sacrifice. The
piece is called by Chambers <i>The Robin's Testament</i>,
and it describes how the bird, on the approach
of death, made a bequest of his several parts,
which he enumerated exactly in the way of the
sacrificial bird-chants current in France. They
were his neb, feathers of his neb, right leg, other
leg, feathers of his tail, and feathers of his
breast, to each of which he attributed a mystic
significance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
 The piece in the combined versions
stands as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Robin's Testament</i> should be compared with
the French piece called <i>Le Testament de l'Ane</i>,
"the testament of the ass," of which a number
of variations have been collected. The "testament
of the ass" was recited outside the church on the
so-called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
 <i>Fête de l'Ane</i>, "the feast of the ass,"
which was kept in many cities of France till a
comparatively recent date. In Douai it was
celebrated as late as the year 1668. On this
occasion an ass was brought into church, and
an office was recited in Latin, which enlarged
on the ass that carried the Holy Family into
Egypt, the ass which bore Christ into Jerusalem,
the ass of Balaam, and so forth. Its chorus
consisted of braying, in which the assembled
canons joined. This service in church was preceded
by a recitation outside the holy edifice,
which was in the vernacular, and which, in dialogue
form, enlarged on the several parts of the
ass.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>One of these dialogue pieces, current in Franche-Comté,
describes how the she-ass, conscious of the
approach of death, bequeathed her feet and ears
to her son, her skin to the drummer, her tail to
the priest to make an aspergill, and her hole to
the notary to make an inkpot (B., p. 61).</p>

<p>Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
 version, at greater length, is in the form
of instruction which is given by the priest to the
child, whose answers are set in cumulative form.</p>

<p>"The feast of the ass," in the words of Bujeaud,
"must have been very popular, since I have often
heard the children of Angoumais and Poitou
recite the following piece ":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="small"><p>Le prêtre: Que signifient les deux oreilles de l'âne?</p>

<p>L'enfant: Les deux oreilles de l'âne signifient les deux
grands saints, patrons de notre ville.</p>

<p>Le prêtre: Que signifie la tête de l'âne?</p>

<p>L'enfant: La tête de l'âne signifie la grosse cloche et
la langue fait le battant de cette grosse cloche qui est
dans le clocher de la cathédrale des saints patrons de
notre ville.</p>

<p class="deepind">(B. I., p. 65.)<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"The priest: What do the ears of the ass stand for?&mdash;The
child: The ears of the ass stand for the two great
patron saints of our city.&mdash;The priest: What does the
head stand for?&mdash;The head stands for the great bell, and
the tongue for the clapper of the great bell which is
in the belfry of the cathedral of the holy saints, the
patrons of our city."</p></blockquote>

<p>We then read of the throat which stands for
the entrance to the cathedral&mdash;the body for the
cathedral itself&mdash;the four legs, its pillars&mdash;the
heart and liver, its great lamps&mdash;the belly, its
alms-box&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
the tail which stands for the aspergill&mdash;the
hide which stands for the cope of the priest&mdash;and
the hole which stands for the holy-water
stoup.</p>

<p>This chant on the parts of the ass is among the
most curious survivals. At first one feels inclined
to look upon it as intended to convey ridicule,
but this idea is precluded by the existence of
<i>The Robin's Testament</i>, and by the numerous
pieces which enumerate the several parts of the
bird in connection with the bird sacrifice. Again
in this case we are led to look upon the piece
as a garbled survival of some heathen form of
ritual. The ass, however, was not known in
Western Europe till a comparatively late period
in history. It has no common Aryan name, and
the question therefore arises how it can have
come to be associated with what is obviously a
heathen form of ritual.</p>

<p>Mannhardt, with regard to German folk-lore,
pointed out that the ass was substituted in many
places for the hare, which was tabu, and with
which it shared the peculiarity of having long
ears. This substitution was favoured by their
likeness of name: <i>heselîn</i>, <i>heselken</i>. (M., p. 412.)</p>

<p>We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
 are led to inquire if the ass in Western
Europe can have taken the place of another
animal also, and we find ourselves confronted
with the following facts:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dicky</i> among ourselves is applied to a bird,
especially to a caged (? perhaps a sacrificial) bird;
the word Dicky is also widely applied to an ass,
properly to a he-ass.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The ass is often called
by nicknames exactly like the small wild birds:
Jack-ass, Betty-ass, Jenny-ass, in form closely
correspond to Jack-daw, Magpie, and Jenny Wren
of the feathered tribe. The word Jack-ass moreover
is applied both to the four-footed beast and
to a member of the feathered tribe. Nicknames
probably originated in the desire to conceal a
creature's true identity.</p>

<p>In Scotland the word <i>cuddy</i> again stands both
for an ass and for some kinds of bird, including
the hedge-sparrow and the moor-hen.<a name="FNanchor_71a_71" id="FNanchor_71a_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The word
cuddy is said to be short for Cuthbert, but it
seems to be related also to cutty, an adjective
applied to the wren (cf. above, p. 176, 193), the
derivation and meaning of which are uncertain.</p>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
 same overlapping of terms exists in France,
where the ass is popularly called Martin (Ro., IV,
206, 223, 233), while the feathered martins
include the <i>martin pêcheur</i>, kingfisher, the <i>martin
rose</i>, goatsucker, and the <i>martinets</i> (Ro., II, p. 70).
In Germany also, where no bird-chants are
recorded, as far as I am aware, the expression
<i>Martinsvogel</i> is applied to a bird of augury of
uncertain identity, sometimes to the redbreast
(Gr., p. 946). And a current proverb has it,
<i>Es ist mehr als ein Esel der Martin heisst</i>, "he
is more than an ass who is called Martin." (Ro.,
IV, 233.) In Barmen boys parade the streets
on the eve of St. Martin's Day, asking for contributions,
and, if they receive nothing, they
sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Mäten ist ein Esel, der zieht die Kuh am Besel.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(B., p. 363.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"Martin is an ass, he pulls the cow by the tail," that is,
"he has no money in his purse."</p></blockquote>

<p>These various survivals support the view that
the ass in Western Europe somehow got mixed
up with the birds. When and how this came
about is difficult to tell. The representatives
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
 Christianity were in a position to accept the
feast of the ass, since the ass figured largely in
the Old and the New Testaments. But we do
not know if they consciously did so, and introduced
the ass in the place of another animal, or
if they took over an animal which had before
their time been accepted in the place of a bird.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="chap">THE ROBIN AND THE WREN</p>


<p class="cap noin">ONE side of the subject remains to be discussed.
It is the relation of the robin to
the wren. Many custom rhymes, legends, and
nursery pieces name the birds together, and they
sometimes enlarge on the jealousy of the birds,
and on the fact that their presence was reckoned
mutually exclusive. Perhaps the birds, looked
at from one point of view, were accounted the
representatives of the seasons, and, as such, came
and went by turns.</p>

<p>The robin and the wren are mentioned together
in several custom rhymes, some of which mention
other birds also:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">The robin redbreast and the wren<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Are God's cock and hen.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(1826, p. 292.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>In Warwickshire they say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
<span class="i4">The robin and the wren<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Are God Almighty's cock and hen;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The martin and the swallow<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Are God Almighty's bow and arrow.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(1870, p. 188.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Lancashire this takes the form:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">The robin and the wren are God's cock and hen;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The spink and the sparrow are the de'il's bow and arrow.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(1892, p. 275.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This association of the sparrow with the bow
and arrow reappears in some nursery pieces, as
we shall see later.</p>

<p>The robin and the wren are coupled together
also in the following rhyme from Scotland, which
has found its way into some modern English
nursery collections:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">The robin redbreast and the wran<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Coost out about the parritch pan;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And ere the robin got a spune<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The wran she had the parritch dune.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(1870, p. 188.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>The Robin's Testament</i> already quoted concludes
with anger on the part of the robin
at the entrance of the wren, whose appearance
heralds his death. Other pieces describe the
inverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
 case, when the wren dies in spite of the
robin's efforts to keep her alive. This conception
forms the subject of a Scottish ballad called <i>The
Birds' Lamentation</i>, which is included in the collection
of David Herd of the year 1776. It
contains the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Wren she lyes in Care's bed, in meikle dule and pyne, O!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quhen in came Robin Red-breast wi' sugar saps and wine, O!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Now, maiden will ye taste o' this?&mdash;It's sugar saps and wine, O!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Na, ne'er a drap, Robin, (I wis); gin it be ne'er so fine, O!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Ye're no sae kind's ye was yestreen, or sair I hae mistae'n, O!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye're no the lass, to pit me by, and bid me gang my lane, O!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quhere's the ring that I gied ye, ye little cutty quean, O!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;I gied it till an ox-ee [tomtit], a kind sweat-heart o' myne, O!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The same incidents are related of real birds in
the toy-book called <i>The Life and Death of Jenny
Wren</i>, which was published by Evans in 1813
"for the use of young ladies and gentlemen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">A very small book at a very small charge,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To teach them to read before they grow large."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
 story begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Jenny Wren fell sick upon a merry time,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">In came Robin Redbreast and brought her sops and wine;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Eat well of the sop, Jenny, drink well of the wine.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Thank you Robin kindly, you shall be mine.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The wren recovered for a time, but her behaviour
was such as to rouse the robin's jealousy.
She finally died, and the book concludes with the
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Poor Robin long for Jenny grieves,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">At last he covered her with leaves.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Yet near the place a mournful lay<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For Jenny Wren sings every day.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was an ancient superstition that the robin
took charge of the dead, especially of those who
died by inadvertence.</p>

<p>The proposed union of the robin and the wren
forms the subject also of a story that was taken
down from the recitation of Mrs. Begg, the sister
of the poet Burns. She was under the impression
that her brother invented it. It describes how
the robin started on Yule morning to sing before
the king, and of the dangers, in the form of
Poussie Baudrons, of the grey greedy gled, of
Tod Lowrie, and of others, he encountered by the
way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
 He sang before the king and queen, who
gave him the wee wren to wed. Then he flew
away and sat on a briar (1870, p. 60). There is
no sequel.</p>

<p>In all these stories the wren is described not
as a cock-bird, but as a hen-bird, which is incompatible
with the idea of kingship that is expressed
by the bird-chants. Perhaps the idea of
the kingship is the older one. For in the legend
told in the Isle of Man as an explanation of the
custom of killing the wren, this bird is described as
a fairy, that is, of the female sex, and legends that
are intended to account for a custom are necessarily
of a more recent date than the custom
which they explain. The wren in Normandy
also is sometimes spoken of as a hen-bird, <i>La
poulette du bon Dieu</i>, God Almighty's hen. One
custom-rhyme current in Scotland directly associates
the bird with the Lady of Heaven:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Malisons, Malisons, mair than tens,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That harry the Ladye of Heaven's hen.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(1870, p. 186.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is another toy-book relating the proposed
union of the robin and the wren, which
leads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
 up to the death of the robin. It is called
<i>The Courtship, Marriage, and Picnic Dinner of
Cock Robin and Jenny Wren</i>, and was first issued
by Harris in 1810. In this book other animals
took part in the ceremony. The cock blew the
horn, the parson rook carried Mother Hubbard's
book, the lark sang, the linnet, the bullfinch, and
the blackbird all officiated. A picnic dinner
followed, to which the raven brought walnuts,
the dog Tray brought a bone, the owl brought
a sack of wheat, the pigeon brought tares, and
so forth. The enjoyment was at its height&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">When in came the cuckoo and made a great rout,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">He caught hold of Jenny and pulled her about.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Cock robin was angry and so was the sparrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Who now is preparing his bow and his arrow.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">His aim then he took, but he took it not right,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">His skill was not good, or he shot in a fright,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For the cuckoo he missed, but cock robin he killed,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And all the birds mourned that his blood was so spilled.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The cuckoo, it will be remembered, was the
bird of the god Thor, and the enemy of matrimonial
bliss.</p>

<p>This story of a bird-wedding does not stand
alone. From France and Spain come a number
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
 pieces which similarly describe the proposed
wedding of birds and end in disaster. In Languedoc
one is called <i>Lou mariage de l'alouseta</i>,
"the wedding of the lark." It begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Lou pinson et l'alouseta<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Se ne voulien maridà.<br /></span>
<span class="deepind">(M. L., p. 490.)</span>
</div></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"The spink (<i>or</i> finch) and the lark intended to
marry. On the first day of the wedding they had
nothing to eat."</p></blockquote>

<p>A gadfly on his neck brought a loaf, a gnat
brought a cask, a butterfly a joint, and a sparrow
brought grapes. The flea jumped out of the bed
and began to dance, and the louse came forth
from the rags and seized the flea by the arm.
Then the rat came out of his hole and acted as
drummer, when in rushed the cat and devoured
him.</p>

<p>Exactly the same story is told in much the same
form in Catalan of <i>La golondrina y el pinzon</i>, "The
goldfinch and the swallow," but the verses on the
gay rat and the destructive cat are wanting (Mi.,
p. 398). Other versions have been recorded in the
centre and in the North of France, one of which
was printed in 1780 (Ro., II, 180, 212; D. B.,
p. 106).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
 From thence the song was probably
carried to Canada, where it reappears as <i>Pinson
et Cendrouille</i>, "The finch and the nuthatch"
(G., p. 275). Here the ending is that the rat played
the fiddle, and the cat rushed in and spoilt the
fun.</p>

<p>These stories of bird-weddings should be compared
with one which describes how the flea and
the louse combined to set up house together and
came to grief. It is told in Catalan of <i>La purga
y er piejo</i> (Ma., p. 74). In Languedoc the same
story is told of <i>La fourmiho e le pouzouil</i>, "the
ant and the flea" (M. L., p. 508). In form these
pieces closely correspond with our bird-wedding.
There is the same communal feast to which the
various guests bring contributions, and the same
revelry which ends in disaster.</p>

<p>This Spanish piece on the housekeeping of the
louse and the flea has a further parallel in the
story called <i>Laüschen und Flöhchen</i>, "The louse
and the flea," which is included in the fairy tales
of Grimm (No. 30). But the German story is told
in the cumulative form of recitation, and its contents
are yet one stage more primitive. There is
nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
 on a wedding celebration. The louse
and the flea set up house together, and began by
brewing beer in an eggshell. The flea fell in by
inadvertence and was drowned. Then the louse
set up the wail. In this the door joined by jarring,
the broom by sweeping, the cart by running,
the dungheap by reeking, the tree by shaking,
till they were all carried away by the brook.</p>

<p>Much the same story, told in cumulative form
also and equally primitive, is current among ourselves.
It seems to be old (1890, p. 454), and
is called <i>Tittymouse and Tattymouse</i>. We read
how Tittymouse and Tattymouse went a-leasing
(gleaning), and set about boiling a pudding.
Titty fell in and was scalded to death. Then
Tatty set up the wail. It was joined by the stool
that hopped, the besom that swept, the window
that creaked, the tree that shed its leaves, the
bird that moulted its feathers, and the girl that
spilt the milk. Finally an old man fell from a
ladder, and all were buried beneath the ruins.
Tittymouse and Tattymouse are usually represented
as mice, but the word tittymouse is also
allied to titmouse, a bird. Titty and Tatty are
among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
 the many rhyming compounds of which
the meaning is no longer clear.</p>

<p>The conceptions on which these pieces are
based all recall primitive customs. The wedding
is a communal feast to which contributions of
different kinds are brought by the several guests.
Again the death of one individual draws that of
a number of others in its wake. On comparing
these various pieces, we find that those which are
set in cumulative form, judging from their contents,
are the more primitive. This supports
the view that the cumulative form of recitation
represents an earlier development in literature
than rhymed verse.</p>

<p>The toy-book on <i>The Courtship of Cock Robin
and Jenny Wren</i> attributes the robin's death to
the carelessness of the sparrow. The sparrow is
also described as causing the death of the robin
in the knell of the robin, which is one of our
oldest and most finished nursery pieces. The
death of the robin is a calamity, his blood is
treasured, he is buried with solemnity. In the
collections of 1744 and 1771 the knell stands as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="smpagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
<span class="i3">1.  Who did kill Cock Robbin?<br /></span>

<span class="i3">2.  Who did see him die?<br /></span>

<span class="i5">I said the beetle, with my little needle,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And I did make his shroud.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>The Death and Burial of Cock Robin</i> formed
the contents of a toy-book that was printed by
Marshall in London, by Rusher in Banbury, and
others. One of the early toy-books belonging to
Pearson, which are exhibited at South Kensington
Museum, contain verses of this knell with quaint
illustrations. The toy-book published by Marshall
which contains the knell, is described as
"a pretty gilded toy, for either girl or boy."
It leads up to the knell by the following verse,
which occurs already as a separate rhyme in the
nursery collection of 1744:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Little Robin Redbreast sitting on [<i>or</i> sat upon] a pole,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Niddle noddle [<i>or</i> wiggle waggle] went his head [tail]<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And poop went his hole.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
 is followed by the picture of a dead robin
with the words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Here lies Cock Robin, dead and cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His end this book will soon unfold.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We then read the four verses of the knell already
cited, and further verses on the owl so brave that
dug the grave; the parson rook who read the
book; the lark who said amen like a clerk; the
kite who came in the night; the wren, both cock
and hen; the thrush sitting in a bush; the bull
who the bell did pull.</p>

<p>In another toy-book the magpie takes the place
of the fly, and from the illustration in a third
one we gather that not a bull but a bullfinch
originally pulled the bell.</p>

<p>The toy-book published by Marshall concludes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">All the birds of the air<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Fell to sighing and sobbing,<br /></span>

<span class="i6">For poor Cock Robin.<br /></span>

<span class="deepind">(Reprint 1849, p. 169 ff.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The antiquity of this knell of the robin is
apparent when we come to compare it with its
foreign parallels, which are current in France,
Italy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
 and Spain. In these rhymes also, those
who undertake the office of burial are usually
birds, but the nature of him whose death is
deplored remains obscure.</p>

<p>In Germany he is sometimes <i>Sporbrod</i>, sometimes
<i>Ohnebrod</i>, that is "breadless" (Sim., p. 70),
a term which may indicate a pauper. The piece
current in Mecklenburg is simpler in form than
ours.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

the eve of the day after to-morrow, with spades and
with shovels. The Cuckoo is the gravedigger, the Stork

sisters and brothers."</p></blockquote>

<p>The knell that is recited in Languedoc is called
<i>Las Campanas</i>, the bells. One version begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Balalin, balalan, La campana de Sant Jan<br /></span>

the knell?&mdash;The four ravens.&mdash;Who bears the coffin?&mdash;The

<p>Another version preserves the trait that the
individual's possessions took part in the mourning:</p>

<blockquote class="small"><p>"Balanli, balanlau, the bells near Yssingeaux are
all tolled through April. Who is dead?&mdash;Jan of the
Gardens (dos Ort). Who carries him to his grave?&mdash;His

the less. What shall we give him?&mdash;The legs of a dog.
Where shall we find them?&mdash;Near Chalençons there

<p><i>Jan dos Ort</i> in other versions of the knell is
called <i>Jean le Porc</i>, also <i>le père du jardin</i>; and in
the latter case, <i>le père petit</i>, the little father, pronounces
him dead, and receives dogflesh (M. L.,
pp. 226, 230).</p>

<p>The Italian knell is quite short:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<blockquote class="small"><p>"Who is dead?&mdash;Crooked Juan. Who mourns for him?&mdash;The
swallow. Who sings for him?&mdash;His coat. Who
calls for him?&mdash;The quail."</p></blockquote>

<p>Victor Smith, with reference to these chants,
enlarged on the possible nature of Jan, or Juan,
of the French and Spanish versions, who is called
also "the father of the gardens," and who was
given dogflesh to eat. In illustration he adduced
the legend of the god Pan, who was looked upon as
the father of gardens, and who was supposed to
eat dogflesh (M. L., p. 227). Dogs were sacrificed
at the Lupercalia which were kept in April,
and the month of April is actually mentioned in
one of the French chants. If this interpretation
is correct, the knells on Jan current in France
and Spain preserve the remembrance, not of a bird
sacrifice, but of a dog sacrifice. But the Italian
name Beccatorto is probably crossbill (R., II, 160),
and birds appear as the chief mourners in most
of the foreign chants, as they do in ours.</p>

<p class="chap">CONCLUDING REMARKS</p>


<p class="cap noin">IN conclusion it seems well to glance back over
the ground that has been traversed, and to
consider what information can be gleaned from
the comparative study of nursery rhymes.</p>

<p>At the outset we saw that our nursery collections
consist of a variety of pieces of diverse
origin. Many rhymes are songs or snatches of
songs which have no direct claim on the attention
of the student of folk-lore. Other pieces are relatively
new, although they contain names that are
old. Thus, Old King Cole and Mother Hubbard
are names that go some way back in history; the
story of the woman who fell asleep out of doors
and forgot her identity, preserves an old tradition;
Jack and Jill are connected with Scandinavian
mythology; while Tommy Linn, the hero of
several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
 nursery pieces, figures in romantic ballad
literature also.</p>

<p>A more primitive form of literature is represented
by traditional dancing and singing games,
to which many nursery rhymes can be traced.
These games in several instances preserve the
remains of celebrations that date from heathen
times. In the last instance they survive as a
diversion of the ballroom. Incidental allusions
enabled us to establish the relation between the
Cotillon, the Cushion Dance, and the game of
<i>Sally Waters</i>. This latter game preserves features
of a marriage rite, which was presided over
by a woman who was addressed as mother. The
words used in the game and the rite suggest that
there may be some connection between the game
of <i>Sally Waters</i> and the name of Sul, the local
goddess of the waters at Bath.</p>

<p>Other traits preserved in the games of <i>The Lady
of the Land</i>, <i>Little Dog I call you</i>, and <i>Drop Handkerchief</i>,
probably date from the same period. For
the comparison of these games with their foreign
parallels enabled us to realize that, in their
case also, it is a question of a presiding mother,
who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
 in some of the German versions of the game,
was addressed by the name of a heathen mother
divinity. <i>Engelland</i>, that is Babyland, and the
disabled condition of the human mother, which
are mentioned in these games, reappear in the
ladybird rhymes. In these we also come across
Ann or Nan, who reappears under the same name
in the corresponding rhymes of Switzerland and
Swabia.</p>

<p>On comparing our rhymes with those of other
countries, we find that the same thoughts and
conceptions are usually expressed in different
countries in the same form of verse. The words
that are used, both in England and abroad, in
dancing and singing games, in custom rhymes like
those addressed to the ladybird, and in riddle-rhymes
such as that in <i>Humpty-Dumpty</i>, are set
in short verse that depends on tail rhyme for its
consistency. Distinct from them are the pieces
that depend for their consistency on repetition
and cumulation. Some of these are obviously
intended to convey instruction, like the chants of
Numbers and of the Creed. Others appear to be
connected with the making and unmaking of
spells.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
 Again in this case, the parallel pieces of
different countries are set in the same form of
verse.</p>

<p>Another class of rhymes is represented by the
chants on bird sacrifice. Those current among
ourselves depend for their consistency on repetition
only, while those current abroad which
present details on the plucking and the dividing
up of the bird, are related in cumulative
form. Perhaps the repetition which preserves the
simpler facts of the custom is the older form of
recitation. The kingship of the wren which is
accepted throughout Europe, and which dates
some way back in history, in some of these chants
is connected with the kingship of the man who
was engaged in the hunt. Possibly the custom
of killing the king was overlaid by the custom of
sacrificing a bird in his stead.</p>

<p>The reverence felt for the wren is equalled
among ourselves by the reverence felt for the
robin, whose knell remains one of our finest, and
perhaps one of our oldest nursery pieces. It is
set in dialogue form, which seems to have been
generally associated with bells, but which was a
primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
 manner of recitation, as we gather
from other pieces.</p>

<p>The information which can be derived from
nursery rhymes corroborates what has been
collected elsewhere concerning different stages of
social history in the heathen past. Some pieces
preserve allusions which carry us back to customs
that prevailed during the so-called mother age;
others, quite distinct from them, are based on
conceptions that may have taken rise before man
tilled the soil. The spread of European nursery
rhymes, taken in the bulk, appears to be independent
of the usual racial divisions. Some of
our rhymes, such as that of the ladybird and
<i>Humpty Dumpty</i> have their closest parallels in
Germany and Scandinavia; others, such as the
bird-chants and the animal weddings, have corresponding
versions in France and in Spain. Moreover,
some of the ideas that are expressed in
rhymes carry us beyond the confines of Europe.
The chafer was associated with the sun in Egypt,
the broken egg engaged the attention of the
thinking in Tibet.</p>

<p>Thus the comparative study of the nursery
rhymes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
 of different countries throws light on
allusions which otherwise remain obscure, and
opens up a new vista of research. The evidence
which is here deduced from some rhymes, and the
interpretation put on others, may be called into
question. Much remains to be said on the
subject. But the reader will, I think, agree that
nursery rhymes preserve much that is meaningful
in itself, and worth the attention of the student.</p>

<p class="cen">TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE:</p>


<p class="noin">Obvious typos and printer errors have been corrected without comment.
Other than obvious errors, the author's spelling, grammar, and use of
punctuation are retained as in the original publication.</p>

The index item "Mister Moffit is a very good man" incorrectly refers to the note on
page 172.  This should refer to the note on page 72 and the hyperlink will direct
the reader to the correct footnote.

<p class="noin">In addition to obvious errors, the following changes have been made:</p>

<blockquote><p class="hang2">Pages 101 and 102: The word "Býskip/ býskips" appears in the original
with an inverted breve over the y. Since this character is not
available in the utf-8 code lists, a variant spelling is used in
this text with an acute over the y.</p>

<p class="hang2">Page 144: endquote removed from the phrase, "... heavens and the
earth...."</p>

<p class="hang2">Page 154: closing parenthesis added in the phrase, "(i.e. the
constellation)"</p>

<p class="hang2">Page 193: "bonuie" changed to "bonnie" in the phrase, "... bonnie
feathers...."</p>

<p class="hang2">Page 205: "it" changed to "its" in the phrase, "... was at its
height...."</p>

<p class="hang2">Page 213: closing quote added in the phrase, "... are plenty." (M. L.,
p. 232.)</p></blockquote>
